            "Published Date": "Umamaheswara Rao / TNN / Updated: Aug 19, 2024, 15:14 IST",
            "Main Content": "Andhra Pradesh experienced a significant drop in food grain production in the 2023-24 agricultural year compared to 2022-23. Key crops like rice, maize, pulses, and oilseeds saw reduced output due to lower acreage and adverse weather conditions, including less rainfall and Cyclone Michaung. VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh has witnessed a notable decline in food grain production during the 2023-24 agricultural year compared to the preceding 2022-23 farming season. The recent final assessments of govt indicate a marked reduction in output for several key crops, including rice, maize, pulses, and oilseeds, attributable to decreases in both cultivated acreage and crop yield. In 2022-23, rice was cultivated across 21.29 lakh hectares, yielding a total of 1.26 crore tonnes. However, the cultivated area contracted to 19.21 lakh hectares in 2023-24, resulting in a reduced harvest of 1.13 crore tonnes. This represents a substantial decrease in both sown area and production. Agricultural officials attribute this decline to drought-like conditions and adverse weather patterns such as cyclones during the last season. For example, there was 15% less rainfall during the southwest monsoon (from June to September 2023) and nearly a 24% deficit during the north-east monsoon, winter period, and hot weather period (from October 2023 to March 2024). On top of this, Cyclone Michaung's heavy downpour in December 2024 exacerbated the existing challenges faced by the farmers. Total food grain production also witnessed a sharp fall in 2023-24. The overall area under food grain cultivation diminished from 36.8 lakh hectares in 2022-23 to 33.24 lakh hectares in 2023-24, leading to a decline in output from 1.6 crore tonnes to 1.43 crore tonnes. Maize production suffered a significant setback. The area dedicated to maize cultivation contracted from 3.86 lakh hectares in 2022-23 to 2.92 lakh hectares in 2023-24, resulting in a production slump from 27.5 lakh tonnes to 18.19 lakh tonnes. Pulses also experienced a downturn in both acreage and yield. In 2022-23, pulses were grown on 10.32 lakh hectares, producing 10.87 lakh tonnes. These figures declined to 9.42 lakh hectares and 8.25 lakh tonnes respectively in the following year. The oilseed sector followed a similar pattern, with cultivated area shrinking from 8.12 lakh hectares in 2022-23 to 5.25 lakh hectares in 2023-24. While the production decrease was less pronounced, it still fell from 28.96 lakh tonnes to 26.63 lakh tonnes. The combined reduction in both cultivated land and output across these major crops raises concerns about the agricultural productivity of Andhra Pradesh, with potential ramifications for food security and the state's economy. Adverse weather conditions during rabi and kharif severely impacted farmers, with rice cultivation particularly affected. Kharif rice sowing was abandoned across 7 lakh acres, and an estimated 10-20% of the planted rice area withered due to drought-like circumstances. Overall, of the targeted 35.75 lakh hectares, only 24.98 lakh hectares were planted in the 2023 Kharif season, leaving over 25% or nearly 25 lakh acres fallow. The Rabi season was no better, with cultivated area limited to approximately 75% of the target. In absolute terms, 16.76 lakh hectares were planted compared to the targeted 23 lakh hectares.",

            "Summary": "Andhra Pradesh has seen a significant decline in food grain production for the 2023-24 agricultural year, primarily due to adverse weather conditions and reduced cultivated acreage. Key crops such as rice, maize, pulses, and oilseeds have all been affected, raising concerns about food security and the state's economy.",

            "Main Content": "Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh, known for its vast paddy acreage, is facing a significant shortfall in paddy production, according to its production figures. The state's average paddy yield between 2017-18 and 2021-22 stood at 3,149 kg per hectare, which was substantially lower compared to the yields of Punjab (4,248 kg/ha), Tamil Nadu (3,491 kg/ha), and Haryana (3,308 kg/ha). This yield gap of 1,099 kg/ha compared to Punjab translates to a 25.7% reduction. This indicates that despite Andhra Pradesh's prominence in paddy acreage, there is significant room for improvement in output per hectare through the implementation of better practices and targeted interventions. The state also faces a striking deficiency in red gram production, with a yield of only 347 kg/ha, while Kerala achieves an impressive 1,632 kg/ha. The yield gap of 1,285 kg/ha represents a staggering 78.7% shortfall, highlighting severe inefficiencies in red gram cultivation in Andhra Pradesh. This disparity calls for targeted interventions to bridge the gap and boost red gram productivity in the state. Similarly, Andhra Pradesh lags behind in maize, groundnut, and cotton production. The state's maize yield stands at 4,098 kg/ha, which, although relatively high, is significantly lower than Telangana's impressive yield of 8,001 kg/ha. The resulting yield gap of 3,903 kg/ha indicates a nearly 48.8% deficit, pointing to the urgent need for enhanced agricultural practices and technological advancements to improve maize productivity in Andhra Pradesh. Groundnut yields in the state are recorded at 785 kg/ha, which is far behind Tamil Nadu's yield of 2,291 kg/ha, resulting in a substantial gap of 1,506 kg/ha (65.7%). These low production levels necessitate a thorough reevaluation of cultivation methods, inputs, and technological innovations to boost groundnut productivity in Andhra Pradesh. In the cotton sector, Andhra Pradesh performs relatively better, producing 518 kg/ha, which is close to Punjab's 698 kg/ha. The yield gap of 180 kg/ha (25.8%) is not as significant as in other crops, but there still remains room for enhancement in the state's cotton production. G Nayana Babu of AP farmers' association said that Andhra Pradesh faces considerable yield gaps across various crops when compared to the leading states in India. 'To address these challenges and enhance agricultural productivity, the state must focus on targeted interventions, such as adopting improved farming practices, leveraging better technology, and implementing efficient resource management strategies. By bridging these yield gaps, Andhra Pradesh can unlock its true potential in the agricultural sector and ensure better livelihoods for its farmers,' said Nayana Babu.",

The state faces considerable yield gaps across various crops, necessitating targeted interventions to improve agricultural productivity.",

The court had instructed the state govt to complete the construction of the plant, which costs over Rs 30 crore and is located at East Boragaon on the city's outskirts, to protect the Deepor Beel the state's only Ramsar site. According to Mrigen Sarania, the mayor of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC), the plant is in its final stages and is already partially operational, processing garbage to produce manure. The city, with a population of around 13 lakh, generates approximately 700 tonnes of garbage daily, and the mayor stated that solid waste management has improved in recent years due to various govt initiatives. The dumping site was relocated to East Boragaon following public resistance at the Thermal Power Complex in Chandrapur in June 2022, where it was initially moved from West Boragaon in 2021 as per a 2019 National Green Tribunal order. The West Boragaon dumping site had been used by the civic body for 13 years since 2008. The mayor mentioned that around 4 lakh MT of the approximately 12 lakh MT legacy waste from West Boragaon has been cleared and converted into manure. However, plastic waste management remains a significant concern for the GMC, as the civic body struggles to obtain plastic waste due to various reasons. The mayor stated that the GMC is working on a system to collect and properly utilize the plastic waste generated in the city. The manure produced from the garbage is being distributed to nurseries and various companies, including cement manufacturers. Furthermore, the mayor revealed that the civic body plans to establish additional garbage transfer stations in the city. These stations serve as storage and segregation points for garbage collected through door-to-door services before it is transported to the solid waste management plant site at Belor Tol in East Boragaon. 'There are four such stations in operation in the city. These are located at Chabipul, Sundarpur, Satgaon and Adabari. Plan is in the pipeline to set up such stations at few more locations like near Guwahati Old Jail at Fancy Bazar, near Purabi Dairy at Sixmile and Mathgharia. These stations help in segregating the garbage,' he said. At present, 60 NGOs are involved in door-to-door garbage collection services under the GMC in 60 wards.",

The establishment of several national-level institutions in the state has been a key factor in this surge, according to academics and education experts.The latest All India Survey of Higher Education (AISHE) report highlights that there were approximately46,000 foreign students studying in Indian institutions during the 2021-22 academic year.Of these, over 2,000 students are enrolled in universities and colleges inBihar. This marks a dramatic increase from just a decade ago when the total number of foreign students in higher education institutions barely reached double digits.The largest concentration of foreign students in Bihar can be found atNalanda University, which is situated near the ruins of the ancient, historically significant Nalanda University. This modern reincarnation of Nalanda boasts an international student body representing more than 30 nationalities, including the USA, Argentina, Cambodia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Congo, South Sudan, Thailand, Vietnam, Zimbabwe and Uganda. For the 2022-23 academic year, the university had 822 students enrolled and the number increased to 1,038 students for the 2023-24 academic year. Of these, 187 areinternational studentspursuing various Master\u2019s and PhD programmes, according to university officials.Another institution in Nalanda, the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara, has also seen an influx of foreign students. \u2018For the current academic year, 80 students from various countries, primarily Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam, have been admitted. These students are largely enrolled in programmes focused on Pali and Buddhist studies,\u2019 the institute\u2019s registrar, Meeta, said.The Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Bodh Gaya has also seen a rise in international admissions. This year, the institute admitted 15 foreign students across different programmes. Thirteen of these students joined the integrated programme in management (IPM), one enrolled in the MBA in digital business management (DBM) and another in the regular MBA programme. The students hail from the USA, Canada, Australia and Nepal, with the majority coming from the USA. According to senior faculty member Sanjay Kaushal, this represents a 400% increase in the enrolment of foreign students at IIM Bodh Gaya compared to previous years.At the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna, 15 international students have been admitted this year. These students come from countries such as the USA, UK, Canada, Indonesia, Sudan Tanzania, Ethiopia and Nepal, with most enrolling in computer science and electronics programs. IIT Patna\u2019s academic dean, A K Thakur, said this diverse intake reflects the institute\u2019s growing global appeal.National Institute of Technology (NIT) Patna has also seen international interest, with five foreign students admitted so far this year. According to academic dean Vivekanand Singh, admissions are still in progress and the number may increase. Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) has welcomed three international students this year. \u2018These students, from Botswana, Myanmar and Yemen, are enrolled in PhD programmes in environmental science and computer science,\u2019 said Rakesh Kumar, chairman of the Office of International Affairs at CUSB.However, the situation is less encouraging at state-run universities in Bihar, where the number of foreign students remains negligible. Currently, Patna University has only one international student, from Romania, who is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree at Magadh Mahila College. Historically, Magadh University attracted a substantial number of foreign students, especially in courses like ancient Indian and Asian studies, Pali and Buddhist studies. However, this number has dwindled, primarily due to the lack of adequate hostel facilities. Sushil Kumar Singh, former head of the Buddhist studies department at Magadh University, has urged the state govt to construct hostels of international standards to attract more foreign scholars.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAVisual StoriesPrevious8 happiness mantras for working professionalsLifestyle8 mindful morning rituals to improve focus and reduce anxietyLifestyle9 Indian recipes that can be cooked in under 10 minutesFood10 South-Indian vegetable delicacies that are a powerhouse of nutritionFood10 garden flowers that are perfect for beginnersLifestyle10 habits of people with high metabolismLifestyle8 plants to make the house look luxurious and expensiveLifestyle8 most powerful and dangerous birds in the wildLifestyle9 Best South Indian breakfasts that perfectly balance nutritionFood8 things kids value the most in their mothersLifestyleNext123Hot Picks2024 Democratic National ConventionJammu Kashmir EarthquakeKolkata doctor rape-murderStock Market TodayColorado Airshow HeatHema Committee ReportMpox Virus IndiaTOP TRENDINGLauren BoebertKhaleel AhmedKolkata Doctor MurderJaspal RanaAnnual India Day ParadeAna NavarroWillie BrownRG Kar HospitalCollege Student Rape BengaluruBarron Trump",

His rapport with NDA allies also played a role in securing his daughter Shambhavi the LJP (Ram Vilas) ticket for the Samastipur Lok Sabha seat, which she won comfortably. Describing Nitish as the 'vikas purush', or development man, the governor said, 'Bihar is fortunate that he has served as the CM for a long time.' Arlekar also praised Nitish for implementing the National Education Policy, 2020, and overseeing the construction of Rajedra Bhawan and a guest house in Raj Bhawan. In his address, Choudhary highlighted the similarities between the lives of Mahatma Gandhi and Nitish Kumar. 'Just as Gandhi implemented numerous initiatives to bring about social and political reforms during the freedom movement, Nitish has launched a range of measures aimed at developing Bihar and instituting reforms,' Choudhary said. However, the RJD reacted strongly to the portrayal of Nitish as 'Bihar ke Gandhi' in the book. 'Comparing Nitish with Gandhi is a direct insult to the father of the nation. Gandhi drove away the British with his ideas of truth and non-violence, but what has Nitish done? He has only switched sides to suit his political interests,' RJD spokesperson Shakti Singh Yadav said.",

On Sunday, Tejashwi released a list of criminal incidents from the past three to four days, highlighting how criminals have run amok in the state. The list includes the murder of three BJP and one JD(U) netas among a total of 87 incidents across the state. According to the list, a BJP functionary, who was a member of the party's working committee, was killed in Siwan, while two BJP functionaries, including Ajay Shah, former general secretary of Bajrangpuri Mandal, were gunned down in Patna. The list also details the killing of JD(U) functionary Jawahar Yadav, who was shot dead in Saharsa on Friday. 'This is a very disturbing crime record of the 'double-engine' govt in Bihar. But have you ever heard the CM speak about the law and order situation, unbridled corruption and crumbling bridges in the state?' Tejashwi wrote in his X post. RJD's chief spokesperson, Shakti Singh Yadav, launched a frontal attack on the NDA regime, saying the opposition has frequently drawn attention to the rising crime rate, but 'it seems the protagonists of power are in a state of unconsciousness'. He alleged that criminals have run rampant, leaving the common masses in a state of terror and uncertainty about their safety. BJP spokesperson Arvind Singh said the RJD has no right to comment on law and order, given its own track record. 'While in power, the RJD provided shelter to criminals, but today, the NDA govt's first priority is to eliminate crime and maintain peace,' Singh told reporters.",

GFP president Vijai Sardesai said he has 'strong objections' to the recent amendments to the Goa Excise Duty Rules that allow entities from outside the state to operate retail liquor shops. He insisted that these amendments be scrapped. 'Goa will not accept laws that expel locals and embrace outsiders. I think this act is a blatant transgression on the Goan liquor business, historically managed by Goans,' said Sardesai. 'I urge you to reconsider this amendment and take immediate steps to ensure that liquor licences, particularly in strategically important areas like Mopa, are granted exclusively to Goans.' The existing laws require a certificate of residence in Goa for at least 25 years to obtain a liquor licence, but the amendment permits non-Goans to operate liquor stores. The amendment directly threatens the livelihood of thousands of Goan families, said Sardesai. Sardesai said that govt's decision is 'deeply concerning' as it undermines the interests of Goans, particularly village entrepreneurs who have been involved in the liquor trade for generations. 'Govt's role should be to protect the interests of its citizens, not to facilitate the entry of external entities that can potentially monopolise the market and displace local traders,' said Sardesai.",

Key legislation on the agenda includes a bill to abolish black magic, an amendment to the prohibition act that would allow the govt to auction vehicles seized in prohibition cases, and a bill targeting the disproportionate assets of corrupt individuals. The Gujarat Special Courts Bill 2024 aims to address the growing issue of individuals amassing vast wealth from illegal activities. Its statement of objects and reasons reads, \"A large number of persons indulge in the commission of offences and accumulate huge property other than their lawful sources of income. There is an urgent need to set up a special court for expeditious confiscation of the above-mentioned properties.\" The Gujarat Prohibition (Amendment) Bill, 2024 will grant the govt the authority to auction vehicles seized in liquor and intoxicant smuggling cases before the court's final order.

The Gujarat Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Evil, and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Bill, 2024 is another crucial piece of legislation.

The govt statement said the appointment of a special public prosecutor was needed due to the high value of the assets involved and the case has been lodged under the Prevention of Corruption Act. In response to summons from the ACB, Sagathiya's family members, including his son Keyur, wife Bhavna, and brother Dilip, recently filed for anticipatory bail in the disproportionate assets case. The court is expected to hear their applications on Aug 21. Sagathiya was arrested in connection with the May 25 TRP Game Zone fire, which killed 27. He allegedly has assets worth 1,128% of his legal income. According to the ACB FIR, Sagathiya's legal income during his tenure was Rs 2.57 crore but the assets in his possession were valued at Rs 29 crore. Police discovered substantial amounts of cash and valuables in his office in the Twin Star building near Nana Mauva last month.

While Deepak claimed the motive was monetary, police are also probing a possible affair. The murder sparked local outrage, leading to protests near the Limbayat police station. SURAT: Rakshabandhan turned tragic for 19-year-old Rohan Patil as he was murdered in broad daylight in the Limbayat area, where he had come to celebrate the festival with his cousins. Police apprehended Deepak Patil (19), a friend of the victim, who claimed that he killed his friend over a financial dispute. However, police are exploring multiple angles, including an affair. Having just passed his Class 12 exams, Rohan was preparing for an entrance test while Patil was employed as a labourer, police said. According to case details, Rohan and Deepak met on the ground near Suman High School at about noon and engaged in a bitter altercation over some issue. As the arguments escalated, Deepak brandished a sharp weapon and slit Rohan's throat. He died on the spot. \"Deepak claims that he killed Rohan over a financial dispute, as he had lent him some money. However, we are also probing an affair-related angle, suggesting that there might have been a confrontation over a woman. We will be able to confirm the precise reason after a thorough investigation,\" a Limbayat police source said. The murder in broad daylight caused anger among local people, who staged a protest near Limbayat police station. Police had to resort to the use of mild force to disperse the gathered crowd. Deputy mayor Narendra Patil, who lives in the same area, also rushed to pacify the agitated people. Rohan, who lived in the Dindoli area, had come to his maternal uncle's house to celebrate Rakshabandhan. Deepak lived near his uncle's house, and the duo had been in touch for five months. Police are not ruling out an affair as the reason for the murder. \"We suspect Rohan had an affair with Patil's relative. This could be one reason why Rohan was killed. We also got to know that Rohan had blackmailed Deepak over some issues and taken money from him a couple of times. We are gathering more evidence,\" an official said.",

The case dates to 2005 when DS Hooda, then an sub-divisional officer inDharuhera, was accused of causing financial loss to the discom by restoring power connection to a company that paid around Rs 53,000 of its total pending electricity bill of Rs 2 lakh. The discom framed charges against Hooda in 2006. In 2008, the discom ordered two increments that Hooda was supposed to get be halted, and Rs 1.3 lakh be recovered from him. In a Nov 2014 ruling, a Gurgaon additional district judge said that Hooda was entitled to get back his increments along with interest at 9% per annum. DHBVN challenged this 2014 order before the high court, alleging that Hooda retired as an executive engineer in Feb 2011 and during his service, he was charge-sheeted in April 2006, which led to the stoppage of his two increments. Justice Suvir Sehgal of thePunjab and Haryana HC, in his order on Aug 6, upheld the district court's ruling. \"The court does not find any illegality or infirmity in the judgment passed by the district court,\" the order read.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAVisual StoriesPrevious8 happiness mantras for working professionalsLifestyle8 mindful morning rituals to improve focus and reduce anxietyLifestyle9 Indian recipes that can be cooked in under 10 minutesFood10 South-Indian vegetable delicacies that are a powerhouse of nutritionFood10 garden flowers that are perfect for beginnersLifestyle10 habits of people with high metabolismLifestyle8 plants to make the house look luxurious and expensiveLifestyle8 most powerful and dangerous birds in the wildLifestyle9 Best South Indian breakfasts that perfectly balance nutritionFood8 things kids value the most in their mothersLifestyleNext123Hot Picks2024 Democratic National ConventionJapan EarthquakeKolkata doctor rape-murderModi Ukraine VisitDG Rakesh Pal diesWhat is Nirbhaya case?Stock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGLauren BoebertKhaleel AhmedKolkata Doctor MurderJaspal RanaAnnual India Day ParadeAna NavarroWillie BrownRG Kar HospitalCollege Student Rape BengaluruBarron Trump",

            "Main Content": "Haryana, in collaboration with five other states and UTs, planned to establish a 100km 'vulture safe zone' to revive vulture populations. The initiative involved a survey to ensure banned drugs like diclofenac are not used. The Bombay Natural History Society assisted in releasing 25 white-rumped vultures in September, promoting safe habitats and conservation efforts. GURGAON: Haryana, in collaboration with five other states and UTs, is planning to earmark a 100km zone where it will release vultures, so the bird's population can be revived in the wild. Called a 'vulture safe zone', it will span across 27 districts of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and UP along with Chandigarh. State forest and wildlife department officials said on Monday that the plan involves a survey of all these districts to ensure that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as diclofenac, ketoprofen and aceclofenac are not used in the region. These drugs, earlier administered commonly to cattle, were responsible for a catastrophic decline in vulture populations in the 1990s. These substances are toxic for vultures, which ended up consuming them while feeding on cattle carcasses. In 2008, central govt prohibited the use of these medicines in veterinary drugs. After the survey that Haryana forest and wildlife department will carry out with the help of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), the plan is to release into the wild 25 white-rumped vultures in Sept. 'A vulture safe zone comprises a 100km radius surrounding the existing vulture population. This zone was chosen from satellite telemetry of white-rumped vultures in Nepal, which demonstrated their ability to traverse up to 100km daily in search of sustenance,' said Vineet Garg, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Haryana. Garg said officials from the state held a meeting with their counterparts from other states on Aug 6 to discuss the roadmap for the plan. Officials said the survey will include assessment of areas where carcasses are dumped, availability of cattle carcasses, number of vultures in a region and presence of other scavengers such as feral dogs and other species. Awareness programmes will be organised to sensitise on-ground govt staff and locals on creating a toxic NSAID-free zone. BNHS scientific officer Prakash Mehta said surveys have been conducted for mass release of vultures, but another one will be carried out before the release of 25 white-rumped vultures in Sept. On the safe zone, Mehta said the site should be in the natural range of vulture species. 'It should possess a suitable habitat with ample food sources. It will be selected by collaborating with local partners to facilitate grassroots efforts. The site should not pose significant threats to vultures. And it should be in proximity to protected areas to support conservation efforts,' he said. After vulture populations plunged 99% in India in the 1990s, BNHS established its Vulture Care Centre in Haryana's Pinjore in 2002. The centre was later upgraded and renamed as the Jatayu Conservation Breeding Centre (JCBC) in 2005. JCBC is currently home to 380 vultures, including 97 white-rumped vultures, 221 long-billed vultures and 62 slender-billed vultures. It had released 8 white-rumped vultures into the wild in 2020.",

Arun (19) came inside holding his chest and said the man shot him. GURGAON: A 19-year-old undergraduate student of architecture, who came home over the weekend to celebrate Rakshabandhan, was shot dead by an unknown assailant at the gate of his house in Faridabad while his siblings sat inside. Two men reached Arun's house in Adarsh Nagar around 12.30pm, and one of them called him outside to talk. Arun's sister, who had tied a rakhi on his wrist just hours before, and his elder brother were inside the house when the incident was reported. Police said a case was filed under BNS Sections 103 (1) for murder and under the Arms Act, and they have launched a manhunt to trace the accused. Cops said Arun, who studied at a college in Rohtak's Sampla, reached his house in the NCR city on Saturday evening. On Monday, after completing rakhi celebrations, Arun's parents went out of the house for some work. He was sitting in the living room with his sister Renu and brother Ajay. According to the complaint, when the unknown man asked Arun to talk to him outside the house, the student said he can talk in front of his siblings. But the man insisted that he come out. \"Arun went to the gate with him, and after a few minutes, we heard a gunshot. Arun came inside the house holding his chest and said the man had shot him. He then collapsed. With the help of my uncle, Lakhmi Chand, I shifted Arun to a local private hospital where he was declared dead,\" Ajay told police.

Two transformers worth Rs 5 crore were damaged. HVPNL urged DHBVN to draft SOPs for maintenance, and officials are investigating the failures for disciplinary actions. Representative Image GURGAON: Poor maintenance of 11 kVA electricity feeders has led to damage of major transformers at 66 kVA substations in Gurgaon and Faridabad, causing unscheduled power cuts, according to Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL). In the last month alone, two major transformers, with a combined cost of Rs 5 crore, were damaged at 66 kVA substations in the two cities. HVPNL chief engineer B S Dahiya has now written to DHBVN chief engineer Vinita Singh flagging the poor maintenance and repairs of 11 kVA feeders and asking the discom to come up with a standard operating procedure (SOP) for maintaining them. In his letter, which was sent recently, Dahiya asked Singh to submit the SPO by Aug end. Singh has now issued directives to superintendent engineers to investigate transformer failures and submit a report. If junior engineers, sub-divisional engineers or executive engineers are found to be at fault, disciplinary action is likely to be taken against them, officials said. DHBVN operates over 1,000 feeders with 11 kVA capacity in Gurgaon, which supply electricity from 66 kVA capacity power sub-stations to residential colonies or societies. An HVPNL official said around 60 of these feeders are connected to the 66 kVA power substation in Sector 56, and trip approximately 1,200 times each month. 'This caused a transformer worth around Rs 2.5 crore to fail last month. It had to be replaced with a new one,' the official said. DHBVN's junior engineers and sub-divisional engineers don't properly ground the poles (which includes connecting a conductor or an electrical device to the earth, providing a safe and stable path for excess electricity to escape) of 11 kVA feeders, HPVNL said. 'Due to the lack of timely repair of 11 kVA feeders at the 66 kVA substations in Gurgaon and Faridabad, we have incurred losses of around Rs 5 crore. One transformer at each of these substations has failed. The damage could have been avoided merely by thorough patrolling and taking certain actions,' an HVPNL official said. If DHBVN officials pay serious attention to the repair of 11 kVA feeders, transformers at substations can be saved from damage, executive engineer Anil Malik said. 'Faults travelling through these cables reach the transformers, causing them to fail,' the HVPNL engineer added. 'Superintendent engineers have been instructed to launch special campaigns for the repair of 11 kVA feeders in their respective areas. If any engineer is found negligent, departmental action will be taken against them,' DHBVN chief engineer Singh told TOI.",

            "Main Content": "Ranchi: Even as OPD services and elective OT procedures in all the six govt-run medical college hospitals in the state remained stalled on Monday due to doctors' strike over the rape and murder of a medico in a Kolkata hospital earlier this month, the Jharkhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) reiterated their demand for the implementation of the Jharkhand medical protection bill to ensure safety of the medicos in the state. Over 1,000 junior doctors from the state-run institutes continued their cease-work demanding justice for the doctor in Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital who was raped and murdered earlier this month. The Junior Doctors' Association (JDA), which is spearheading the protests in Jharkhand, said besides the call for justice for the 31-year-old medico, the association is also demanding improved security measures for the doctors who are on duty at the emergency wings in the state-run hospitals. 'Male doctors are equally at risk in the govt medical colleges. Doctors being assaulted at the hands of patients and their kin is very common in the state and despite our repeated pleas to the state govt, not much has been done to address this issue so far,' Dr Ankit Kumar Mehta, president of JDA, said. Mehta said the indefinite stir by junior doctors, which also includes senior and junior residents, will continue as none from the state health department reached out to them for discussions. The Jharkhand chapter of the IMA on Sunday wrote a letter to chief minister Hemant Soren urging him to implement the doctors' protection bill before his term ends. 'When you were the leader of opposition (2014-19), you had assured to implement the law as and when your party assumed office,' IMA president Dr A K Singh wrote. Dr Pradeep Kumar Singh, secretary of IMA Jharkhand, said: 'For the past seven years, doctors have been demanding a medical protection law which would save us from the assaults of the kin of the patients. The bill was tabled in the state assembly thrice but has not been passed. A fresh bill was brought in the assembly last year, but it has also been sent to the select committee for scrutiny.' Health minister Banna Gupta and health secretary Ajoy Kumar Singh did not respond to TOI's calls.",

            "Main Content": "Bengaluru: Pulling up the state govt over its failure to constitute the Civil Services Board (CSB), Karnataka high court Tuesday directed it to submit its response by Sept 11 with regards to a public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue. Rishab Trakroo, a Bengaluru-based advocate, has filed this PIL. He claimed that despite the directions issued by the supreme court in the TSR Subramanian and others case which was decided as far back as on Oct 31, 2013, wherein the top court directed all the state govts to constitute independent Civil Service Boards within three months and also frame a policy prescribing a minimum tenure of service of civil servants the same was not complied with by the state govt till now. Headed by the chief secretary of the states, a CSB is tasked with protecting bureaucracy from political interference by ensuring a fixed tenure of at least two years for cadre officers and vetting any requests for premature and out-of-turn transfers. The supreme court had felt that the constitution of CSB and the framing of a minimum tenure policy for civil servants would ensure preserving the integrity, fearlessness, and independence of civil servants both at the centre and state levels, the petitioner has added. A division bench comprising Chief Justice NV Anjaria and Justice KV Aravind, after perusing the supreme court's decision, noted that those directions were taken note of by the division bench of the high court, while deciding the Sharath B vs Union of India on June 8, 2021. \"The inaction on the part of the state govt speaks for itself. It transpires from the record that a cabinet sub-committee was constituted. It transpires that the board was supposed to be constituted but subsequently, the proposal was shelved and no concrete action was taken,\" the bench observed. The bench also observed that the conduct in not implementing and acting upon the directions of the supreme court and the order of the division bench of the high court with regards to constituting the civil services board by the state authorities is no less than contumacious and would be tantamount to being a contempt of the directions of the supreme court and adjourned the hearing to enable the state govt to respond.",

But in a meeting held in July in the presence of the chief secretary, it was discussed to come up with new buildings instead of renovating the Satpura Bhawan and Vindhyachal Bhawan buildings. The two buildings came into existence in 1982.Officials in the public works dept said the issue remains on hold, and it is yet to be clear whether the two buildings will be renovated or reconstructed. After the Satpura Bhawan fire in June last year, the govt hired forensic experts from Gujarat to assess the structural strength of the building. The report was submitted to the MP govt.The investigation revealed that the electric cable of the Satpura Bhawan was old and could not bear the load, leading to a short circuit and fire that engulfed the offices of the health and tribal departments on different floors of the building.MP govt officials said the report suggested there was no need to demolish the building. The 200-page report was submitted to the govt in September last year.Officials said the report suggested ways to renovate the building and improve its structural strength. Based on this, a renovation project was created. However, instead of proceeding with the renovation, a proposal to construct new Satpura Bhawan and Vindhyachal Bhawan buildings was floated, and a decision is yet to be taken.On March 9, floors of the Vallabh Bhawan building the most important among the three administrative buildings: Vallabh Bhawan, Satpura Bhawan, and Vindhyachal Bhawanwent up in flames.

The same Vindhyachal Bhawan building caught fire two years later. On October 4, 2015, a fire in the Vindhyachal building charred govt records. On June 12 last year, a major fire in Satpura Bhawan engulfed three floors of the health department and one floor of the tribal department.

INDOR: MP cabinet minister and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has triggered controversy by saying India could face civil war in 30 years due to demographic changes. Claiming he heard this from a 'retired military officer', Vijayvargiya made a public appeal to strengthen the word 'Hindu', which has been divided on caste lines. Congress has condemned Vijayvargiya's statement, calling it irresponsible and demanded a public apology. 'Social harmony is very important for the present times. Recently, I was talking to a retired military officer who is very active in social work. He said the way our country's demography is changing, a civil war will start after 30 years. Such a situation may arise that you people will not be able to live,' Vijayvargiya said at a Raksha Bandhan-eve programme in Indore on Sunday. 'We have to think. We should work on how to strengthen the word 'Hindu',' said Vijayvargiya, alleging that some people want to divide Hindus on caste lines so that they can 'achieve power by using the British policy of divide and rule'. MP Congress spokesperson Neelabh Shukla criticised the minister, saying: 'Vijayvargiya's statement is completely irresponsible. It creates an atmosphere of instability and fear in the country and raises questions on peace and brotherhood. He should publicly apologise.'",

            "Main Content": "Indore: The Indore district administration, after at least 11 deaths at Shri Yugpurush Dham Boudhik Vikas Kendra in the last month, has shifted 26 out of 30 children above 18 years of age, to a Ujjain-based NGO. The decision comes after a series of unfortunate events, including the deaths of several mentally-disabled children and deteriorating health conditions of around 90 others at the ashram in early July. As a precautionary measure, the children were initially shifted to Parmanand Ashram on Khandwa Road following the incidents. But, they were brought back to Shri Yugpurush Dham Boudhik Vikas Kendra, after about 20 days. Subsequently, authorities began the process of transferring around 30 youth above the age of 18 to an NGO in Ujjain. Thirty children at Shri Yugpurush Dham Boudhik Vikas Kendra have crossed the age of 18, making them eligible to be 'freed' from the ashram, explains women and child development department district programme officer Ramniwas Budholia. He said, 'So far, 26 inmates with learning difficulties have been transferred to Sevadham Ashram in Ujjain, while the process for the remaining four is ongoing,' he said, adding that efforts are also being made to reunite a dozen children, who are not orphans, with their parents. The ashram was initially designed to accommodate 100 children, but, it had been housing 142 kids in recent times. Consequently, plans were made to relocate the additional 42 children to other facilities.",

The appointment was cancelled on the ground that he had not finished the diploma course, which was an essential qualification for the post, on the last day of submitting the application, though he acquired the diploma by the time the appointment to the post was made.The bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva and Justice Vinay Saraf, found that there was no dispute on the fact that the petitioner was in the last semester of a two-year diploma course in assistant veterinary field officer (AVFO) when the post of AVFO was advertised in February 2017.However, when the counselling for appointment took place in 2019, he had completed the course.In the online application that he submitted for the post, he wrote \"yes\" in the column asking whether he possessed the minimum qualification required for the post. The court said that he should have been qualified for the post applied for on the last date for submission of the application for recruitment to the post and not the date of appointment. The single-judge bench had made no error in dismissing his plea that since he had acquired the minimum eligibility criteria by the time appointments were made, he should be given a chance.The court refused to entertain the argument of the defence lawyer pointing out that the Supreme Court, in exercise of powers under Section 142 of the Constitution, had allowed a similar petition in Bhupinderpal Singh Vs State of Punjab. The court said the high court doesn't have jurisdiction to exercise powers under Article 142 of the Constitution and the Supreme Court had done it in the case in question due to exceptional circumstances of the case and since it involved not one but many candidates.\"Reliance placed by counsel for the appellant on the judgement of the Supreme Court in Bhupinderpal Singh Vs. State of Punjab, to contend that once the appointment order has been issued, the same should not be disturbed to do complete justice under the facts and circumstances of the case, is misplaced. We may note that in the Bhupinderpal Singh case, the Supreme Court has held that a loose practice of permitting candidates to have their eligibility in relation to public employment determined by reference to the date of interview is not correct and must be put to an end.\" the judges said.However, it was pointed out on behalf of the several appellants/petitioners before the apex court that the practice prevalent in Punjab has been to determine the eligibility by reference to the date of interview and there are innumerable cases wherein such candidates have been seeking employment as were not eligible on the date of making the applications or the last date appointed for receipt of the applications but were in the process of acquiring eligibility qualifications and did acquire the same by the time they were called for and appeared at the interview. Several such persons have been appointed but no one has challenged their appointments and they have continued to be in public employment. Such a loose practice, though prevalent, cannot be allowed to be continued and must be treated to have been put to an end,\" the Supreme Court said while stating, \"In our opinion, in view of the appointment letters having been issued, the selection and appointment of such candidates should not be disturbed and that order we make under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice in the facts and circumstances of the cases before us as already stated,\" the apex court had said, recalled the judges.

The association, in the letter to the govt, has said that toll roads connecting to the national highways, especially within 200 km of Indore, are in bad shape due to a lack of proper repairs and maintenance.

According to truckers, Indore witnesses an estimated movement of approximately 4,000 commercial vehicles on a daily basis. 'Apart from damage to goods and vehicles, the risk of accidents has increased due to damaged roads. The toll operators should be made liable for proper repair and maintenance of roads,' said Mukati.

The announcement came after public protests following the arrest of a school sweeper in the case. Deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, who also holds the home portfolio, announced the setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) under inspector general of police Aarti Singh and the appointment of advocate Ujwal Nikam as the public prosecutor in the matter. \"It is a serious incident where two school girls have been assaulted by a safai karmachari. An IG-level woman officer, Aarti Singh, will head the SIT. It is the govt's endeavour to ensure there is a quick enquiry, a charge-sheet is filed, and the case is heard in a fast-track court so that the affected family gets justice at the earliest,\" Fadnavis said, adding that a proposal had been called for the setting up of a fast-track court. Shinde said action would be taken against the management of an institution if there was an incident of abuse of girls. He said institutions needed to conduct a background check of their employees. In the afternoon, Fadnavis said the Thane police commissioner had been directed to immediately suspend the Badlapur police station senior inspector, assistant police sub-inspector and head constable for alleged delay in taking action on the complaint. Shinde told the media that he had spoken to the police commissioner and asked for an attempt to rape case to be filed. \"I have asked for cases to be filed under attempt to rape and POCSO. The accused will face strong punishment,\" Shinde told TV channels. He said a special public prosecutor would be appointed in the case. He said if the police were found to have delayed filing charges then action would be taken against them. \"No one will be spared,\" he said. Shinde held a meeting with education minister Deepak Kesarkar and suggested setting up a complaint box in every school for students or parents facing problems. \"There should be a system in place so that if the student has any doubts, they should be able to immediately point it out to the principal or teachers without fear,\" he said. \"The management should immediately talk to the teachers and staff of all the schools and take appropriate care.

            "Main Content": "Maharashtra inaugurated its first solar village, Manyachiwadi, with rooftop solar panels for 97 residential connections. The project, under PM Suryaghar Muft Bijali Yojana, offers zero electricity bills for up to 300 MW per month. The initiative aims to solarise 100 villages, supporting households and farmers with free power and additional income opportunities. Chief minister Eknath Shinde during inauguration of the complete solarisation of the village Manyachiwadi in Satara district. MUMBAI: Maharashtra has finally got its first-ever solar village, with the inauguration of the complete solarisation of the village Manyachiwadi in Satara district by chief minister Eknath Shinde. During the inauguration, Shinde said that zero electricity bills for households in the village, which will now reap the benefits of rooftop solar, are due to the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijali Yojana. This scheme, established by the Central Govt, aims to provide 300 units of free power to one crore households across the country. MSEDCL director Prasad Reshme said that the entire village, with a population of 420, has been given 102 rooftop solar connections. Of these, 97 connections are for residential use, wherein the consumers can enjoy free power up to 300 MW every month, resulting in zero electricity bills. Additionally, if the consumers generate surplus solar energy, they can earn extra income by selling it back to MSEDCL. The street lights in the area have also been energised through grid solar, and the public water supply system works on renewable energy. The school, gram panchayat office, and a flour mill in the village also have rooftop solar installations to meet their energy requirements. MSEDCL managing director Lokesh Chandra said that there is 100% solarisation in the village, and the CM has now set a target of 100 such villages being solarised across Maharashtra. Under the Pradhan Mantri Suryaghar Free Electricity Scheme, domestic consumers in the selected villages will be eligible for a maximum subsidy of Rs 78,000 for installing solar panels with a capacity of up to 3 kW. This will help them generate electricity for their own consumption and potentially earn additional revenue by selling excess power back to MSEDCL at Rs 2.87 per unit. An MSEDCL spokesperson from Baramati said that Manyachiwadi village has already begun generating surplus solar power, and therefore every resident will earn extra income per month. Farmers in the village can also benefit from daytime and free power as per the govt scheme for solar pumps up to 7.5 HP. At the event, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that in the next one and a half years, 12,800 MW of solar power capacity will be developed in the state to provide power for irrigation during the daytime. This means that farmers will not be required to visit farms during the night for irrigation, and there will be daytime power for farms for eight to ten hours. In Maharashtra, the goal is to install rooftop solar in 20 lakh households. So far, approximately 3.5 lakh consumers have registered for the scheme, with 2.3 lakh applying through the Mahavitaran portal.",

'BJP has created the problem of reservation. In 2014, it was Fadnavis who had assured to provide quota to Marathas, Dhanagars, and tribals. Surprisingly, in the last 10 years, BJP and Modi have failed to resolve the dispute,' said Patole. We also published the following articles recently: Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis downplays BJP chief post buzz, says it's just media hype. Devendra Fadnavis dismissed media reports suggesting he was being considered for the BJP president's role, terming them as mere media speculation. Amid this, he mentioned that a government resolution on electricity bill waivers for farmers had been issued and would continue for five years. This came amid prior allegations involving Shiv Sena (UBT) leaders. Quota row: Supreme Court bats for the deprived among unequals. The Supreme Court ruled that children of Scheduled Caste (SC) parents who have reached high social positions cannot claim reservations like those studying in rural schools. Justice Gavai urged states to exclude the 'creamy layer' among SCs and STs from reservation benefits. The decision aims to ensure genuine equality in accessing affirmative action. Param Bir targeted me at Fadnavis' behest, says Anil Deshmukh; BJP denies. Anil Deshmukh, former Maharashtra home minister, claimed that Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis shielded ex-Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh from arrest by urging him to make accusations against Deshmukh to destabilize the MVA government. The BJP denied the allegations, labeling them slanderous, and questioned how Fadnavis, then in opposition, could influence a police officer in such a manner.",

            "Main Content": "The ministry of social justice and empowerment has, as part of draft amendments to the Rules of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, proposed issuing white unique disability ID (UDID) cards to those with less than 40% disability. This comes in the wake of probationary IAS officer Puja Khedkar getting three disability certificates from two hospitals in Ahmednagar and Pune districts after changing her name and surname and with different residential addresses. On July 29, the ministry published these draft changes, introducing a new colour-coded system for UDID cards. White cards would be issued to those with disability levels below 40%, yellow cards for 40-80% disability, and blue cards for more than 80% disability. The draft amendments have also proposed extending the timeframe for issuing disability certificates and UDID cards to three months instead of one month. This extended timeline aims to allow medical authorities more time for a thorough assessment. Ministry officials told TOI on Tuesday that they are plugging loopholes in the system. 'The draft rules and a standard operating procedure have been in place and can be seen on our website. After the Khedkar case, we are taking caution and the entire system is being revamped. The Centre has sought suggestions on the draft rules before the end of this month, after which they will be implemented,' an official said. Khedkar came under the radar for having procured certificates thrice for various disabilities. Activists have raised concerns over the new rules, saying there could be delays in accessing benefits and services. 'Even otherwise earlier applications would not be cleared on time. Now, the three-month timeframe will delay certificates further,' Suhana Khan, a disability activist. The UDID portal issues would be sorted out before the end of this month, an official from the ministry said on Tuesday.",

The city has only two assistant RTOs as against the sanctioned strength of four. The regional transport office for Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar last had a full-time RTO on June 20, 2020. The key post was looked after as an additional charge by lower-level authorities later. Currently, RTO Ahmednagar is serving as the acting RTO for Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. The vacuum at the key govt establishment has evoked sharp reactions from different stakeholders, who have sought official intervention for appointments of full-time authorities.

This is not a valid reason for not renewing my licence for a bona fide resident. I am unable to drive my car,' he said.

'Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Jalna and Beed districts come under the jurisdiction of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar office. The govt must act swiftly to fill the vacant post of the RTO,' he said. A leader of transport union said red-tapism has increased at the Regional Transport Office at Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. 'We experience inordinate delay in getting routine work done. This is solely because of no presence of top officers,' he said preferring anonymity. A senior RTO official, however, said the work was going on well on different fronts barring exceptions. 'There is no denying to the fact full-time authorities are needed. We are managing resources well,' he said on the condition of anonymity.

Farmers in the village can also benefit from daytime and free power as per the govt scheme for solar pumps up to 7.5 HP. At the event, deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that in the next one and a half years, 12,800 MW of solar power capacity will be developed in the state to provide power for irrigation during the daytime. This means that farmers will not be required to visit farms during the night for irrigation, and there will be daytime power for farms for eight to ten hours. In Maharashtra, the goal is to install rooftop solar in 20 lakh households. So far, approximately 3.5 lakh consumers have registered for the scheme, with 2.3 lakh applying through the Mahavitaran portal.",

            "Main Content": "Kolhapur: Mahavikas Aghadi is once again facing cracks in Sangli district over MP Vishal Patil's support to Shiv Sena aspirant from Khanapur assembly segment. During the Lok Sabha election earlier this year, Vishal contested the election despite the seat being allotted to the Shiv Sena (UBT), creating a rift in the alliance. Now, he has declared support to Shiv Sena's Suhas Babar and left the Sena (UBT) party workers fuming. A couple of days back, Patil publicly said that he was helped by Babar, the son of late MLA Anil Babar, during the Lok Sabha polls and that he would reciprocate the help by securing lakhs of votes for him in the assembly election. 'We are going to complain to UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray about the decision of the MP. Vishal Patil has declared support to Congress in Parliament and he is now part of MVA. After betraying Sena (UBT) in the Lok Sabha election, Congress is trying again to betray our party. Therefore, I am going to demand that our leader should declare that there is no alliance with Congress limited to Sangli district,' said Sanjay Vibhute, district president of Sena (UBT). Recently, Vishal Patil and Congress MLA Vishwajeet Kadam met Uddhav in New Delhi to bring a thaw in their strained relationship. 'Uddhav Thackeray forgave him and Congress despite the betrayal. However, Vishal Patil has started showing his true colours,' said Vibhute. Vishal is the 43-year-old grandson of ex-CM Vasantdada Patil.",

The issue was raised with DoNER minister Jyotiraditya Scindia recently. Biren took to social media on Saturday to inform about the development. The mistake was identified in chapter 3 of NEC Vision Plan 2047, titled 'Art, Culture and Natural Heritage', which discussed the migration of ethnic tribes in the northeastern region.

Chin State is actually located in Myanmar, which shares an international border with Manipur and Mizoram. In the wake of clashes between anti-junta forces and the govt in Myanmar, tens of thousands of people have fled the Chin State and entered neighbouring areas in the northeast of India. The vision document said, 'The NER is home to more than 200 ethnic and tribal communities. The Patkai range, dividing the riverine tropical land of Myanmar from the Brahmaputra Valley, has nurtured tribes spanning the Patkai as well as the trans Patkai movement.' It also noted the extensive migration into this part of the world over the past two millennia, specifically mentioning the Kuki (Chin) from the 'Chin State of Manipur' as a notable one.

The division bench of chief justice Vijay Bishnoi and justice Suman Shyam granted six weeks for the submission of these affidavits. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by Asom Basaok, raising concerns about encroachments in the reserve forest land areas in Assam bordering the mentioned states. Considering that most encroachments have been made in the reserve forest areas of Assam bordering Mizoram, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, the court directed the neighbouring states to file their responses on July 26 last year. The court observed that efforts were made by Assam, in coordination with the secretaries concerned of Mizoram, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, to resolve the issue of illegal encroachments, irrespective of the boundary disputes with these states. Although affidavits have been filed by Mizoram, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, the court stated that these affidavits did not provide any suggestions to make the reserve forest land in the inter-state border areas encroachment-free. Assam's advocate general D Saikia submitted to the court that earlier efforts by the Assam govt to remove encroachments in the Inner Line Reserve Forest area on the inter-state border of Assam and Mizoram, had been resisted by people from Mizoram. 'Having taken into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, we deem it appropriate to direct the counsel representing Mizoram, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh to file their respective affidavits mentioning the measures carried out by these states to remove the illegal encroachments in the reserve forest land situated in the inter-state border of these states with Assam,' the HC stated.",

            "Main Content": "The Rising People's Party (RPP) criticized the Nagaland government for failing to address law and order issues after death threats to businessman K Rulho by the NSCN (Khango). The party accused the government of shirking responsibility and highlighted the need for strong action against anti-social elements, urging better empowerment of the state police force. DIMAPUR: The Rising People's Party (RPP) on Sunday not only condemned the death threats issued to K Rulho, proprietor of M/s KKB Rulho, by the NSCN (Khango) but also slammed the NDPP-BJP coalition govt in Nagaland for passing the buck to the Cease Fire Monitoring Group (CFMG)/Cease Fire Supervisory Board (CFSB) on the issue. In a statement issued by its president Zoel Naga and vice-president Vitho Zao, the RPP also said the various civil society organisations, including the youth and the business/trade bodies, need not bypass the govt on the issue. 'The elephant in the room is the state govt which has totally failed to uphold law and order in the state. To recap, maintenance of law and order is a state subject, not the outlook of CFMG/CFSB,' the statement said. The RPP said never to take responsibility for anything, the state govt has once again passed the buck to CFMG/CFSB, perhaps taking a hint from a certain organisation. It also reminded deputy CM Y Patton that 'you do not 'request' anti-social elements to refrain from anti-people activities - you arrest'. Alleging that the unwillingness of the political leadership to give a free hand to the state police force continues, the RPP said the state police is more than capable of tackling the issue of extortion within a week. It also rued that today no organisation is willing to bell the cat called the state govt. 'Unless this reality is accepted and digested, the sword of damocles will continue to swing over our heads,' the party added. Alleging that the Neiphiu Rio-led NPF govt first came to power in 2003 with the help of a certain faction, RPP said it was a political alliance to dislodge the then SC Jamir ministry. It added after winning the election, Rio's govt immediately unleashed its policy of 'equi-closeness' with all the factional groups when barely four to five factions were operational in the state.

The statements were made during the Rakhar Punia festival event in Amritsar district. Launching into a blistering attack on the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Punjab chief minister (CM) Bhagwant Singh Mann on Monday accused it of seeking votes in the name of \"protecting panthic interests\" while consistently \"failing\" to address Punjab-specific issues in Parliament. Speaking on the occasion of Rakhar Punia festival at Baba Bakala in Amritsar district, Mann pointed out that even when the SAD claimed to be a panthic and pro-Punjab party, it had never raised issues related to Punjab in Parliament. The Punjab CM recalled his 2018 appeal to then Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan to honour the Sahibzadas on their martyrdom day, which he said had led to a historic tribute. The CM also condemned the SAD for allegedly \"failing to make similar efforts\" despite their panthic claims. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader also criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), asking the saffron party that governs the country, to reflect on its governance in states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, \"where curfews had to be imposed during various religious festivals.\" At the same time, he pointed out the alleged worsening law and order situation, specifically mentioning the recent curfew in Nuh district of Haryana. Taking aim at the opposition leaders such as senior Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa and BJP state chief Sunil Jakhar, he spoke of their \"political decline\" following a significant defeat in the Jalandhar West byelection. He said that the people of Punjab had sent a clear message that politics should not be driven by \"nepotism\" and only those who genuinely advocate for the common people can attain power.",

The agitation was triggered by the previous Congress govt's decision to reduce the entry pay scale of veterinary officers from Rs 56,100 to Rs 47,600, which was implemented by the then finance minister, Manpreet Badal. As per the JAC, the move not only defies the orders of the Punjab and Haryana high court, but also disregards the recommendations of the 5th and 6th Punjab Pay Commissions and the 7th Central Pay Commission, all of whom had recommended parity between the veterinary and medical doctors.

BAP sought Chorasi and Salumber, while RLP aimed for Khinvsar. Congress, left with Jhunjhunu, Dausa, and Deoli-Uniara, faced resistance from its own members over seat concessions to coalition allies. JAIPUR: Even before the dates for bypolls in six Rajasthan assembly seats are to be announced, tension has begun surfacing among INDIA bloc partners. Bharat Adivasi Party (BAP), which contested the Banswara Lok Sabha seat with Congress support recently, is demanding two assembly seats Chorasi (Dungarpur) and Salumber (Udaipur), where it has a sizeable presence. Another INDIA bloc ally, Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), is firm on contesting the Khinvsar seat (Nagaur), leaving Congress with just three seats Jhunjhunu, Dausa and Deoli-Uniara (Tonk). The BAP and RLP demands highlight the emerging cracks in the national alliance as the parties negotiate seat-sharing arrangements. BAP national president Mohan Lal Roat told TOI, \"Undoubtedly, we shall vie for Chorasi and Salumber seats, as both are reserved for tribal candidates. I am confident that just as it happened at the eleventh hour in the Lok Sabha elections, Congress will rally behind our candidates in both these assembly seats.\" He acknowledged the absence of formal discussions with Congress regarding the coalition in bypolls but expressed conviction that the grand old party's leadership recognises the indispensability of BAP's support in thwarting arch rival BJP from making electoral inroads in the tribal belt. Chorasi seat fell vacant following the triumph of BAP candidate Rajkumar Roat in Lok Sabha elections, while Salumber got vacated upon the untimely demise of BJP MLA Amritlal Meena. In Salumber, BAP candidate Jitesh Kumar Meena secured the third position in 2023 assembly elections. BAP, which came into existence in Sept 2023 and currently holds three MLAs and one Lok Sabha seat in Rajasthan, has emerged as the third-largest party after Congress and BJP in the state. Former Congress MP from the tribal area, Raghuveer Singh Meena voiced his objection to BAP's claim over both the assembly seats. \"While the Congress high command will determine the feasibility of an alliance with BAP, my personal stance is that the party should refrain from conceding both seats to BAP, as it would only undermine our party's prospects in the future,\" Meena said. RLP has unequivocally expressed its intention to contest in Khinvsar and Dausa, posing a predicament for Congress, which is only inclined to offer Khinvsar. A senior Congress functionary contended that the party should waste no time in staking its claim on all six seats. \"The reticence of senior party functionaries regarding contesting the bypolls is enabling BAP and RLP to foster an impression among the populace that they are an integral part of the alliance. This is disheartening for Congress workers who are riding high on the resounding success in the Lok Sabha polls,\" the senior Congressman remarked.",

The Met office in Jaipur attributed this rise in temperatures to almost negligible monsoon activity, except for Sam in Jaisalmer, which recorded a rainfall of 70mm. According to the Met office, the weakening of the monsoon winds in many parts of the state is due to the vanishing of upper air cyclonic circulation and easterly winds. As a result, no major rainfall activity is expected in the state till Aug 21. People in Jaipur woke up to cloudy conditions on Sunday morning, which was followed by a bright sunny day. The absence of rainfall led to an increase in both maximum and minimum temperatures, which were 35.2 degrees Celsius and 26.8 degrees Celsius, respectively. Met office has predicted that cloudy conditions will prevail in the coming days, with the possibility of scattered rainfall, mostly on the outskirts of Jaipur district. After Dholpur, Karauli recorded the second-highest maximum temperature at 36.9 degree Celsius, followed by Churu 36.2, Sangariya (Hanumangarh) 36, Fatehpur 35.6, Pilani 35.2, Sriganganagar 35, Barmer 34, Bikaner 34.8, Ajmer 33.5, Bhilwara 33.4, Jodhpur 33.2 and Jaisalmer 33 degrees Celsius.

The remarkable rise intobacco useamong both men and women calls for immediate government action to bolster tobacco cessation policies and introduce safer alternatives.Dr Moitreyee Kalita, consultant-pulmonary medicine at Dispur Polyclinic and Hospitals Pvt Ltd, said, 'The significant rise in tobacco use among men and women in northeastern states such as Mizoram and Sikkim has led to a severe health crisis. With nearly 267 million adults using tobacco across India, as reported by the Global Adult Tobacco Survey India, 2016-17, the problem is escalating. It is imperative for the govt to urgently revisit and strengthen tobacco cessation policies to introduce safer novel alternatives.'According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019-20), tobacco consumption among men in Mizoram has increased to 72.9%, and among women to 61.6% up from 64.9% and 52.4%, respectively, as reported in the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS, 2016-17). Sikkim has also experienced a surge, with male tobacco users increasing to 41.3% and female users to 11.7%, compared to 26.4% and 8.4% in the previous survey.'Alternatives should be allowed only for serious smokers, providing scientifically proven options to those who genuinely want to quit but struggle due to lack of availability. We need to merge effective global strategies from countries like Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the USA, and consult experts to introduce safer novel alternatives like HTP for quitting smoking,' Dr Kalita said.The concerning statistics underscore the pressing need to tackle regional disparities in tobacco consumption, particularly in the northeast. Nationally, the primary forms of tobacco use include smokeless products like khaini, gutkha, betel quid with tobacco, and zarda, as well as smoking forms like bidi, cigarettes, and hookah. However, the disproportionately high usage in Mizoram and Sikkim and surrounding areas presents unique challenges, health experts said.Dr Narender Saini, former general secretary of the Indian Medical Association, said, 'The data from NFHS-5 (201920) and GATS (201617) indicate a staggering regional prevalence of tobacco use that cannot be ignored. It is essential to adopt comprehensive tobacco control strategies that incorporate both prevention and cessation. The government and health authorities should prioritize educational campaigns and provide resources for cessation programs that are both accessible and effective. The role of novel alternatives in these regions should not be underestimated. They could serve as critical tools in reducing tobacco dependency dramatically.'About the AuthorKangkan KalitaKangkan Kalita is a reporter with The Times of India and covers issues on health, education, stories of human interest while keeping a close watch on political developments and student movements.

            "Main Content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Stalin said strong opposition from the INDIA bloc led the BJP-led NDA government to withdraw the lateral entry recruitment process. He stressed the need for a nationwide caste census and breaking the 50 percent reservation ceiling. Stalin urged vigilance against threats to reservation policies. NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister Stalin on Tuesday exuded confidence that a \"strong opposition\" from the INDIA bloc was able to push the BJP led NDA govt to the wall and force it to retract from proceeding with the recruitment process under lateral entry. The Dravidian leader also took the opportunity to harp on to his long standing call for a nationwide caste census and pitched the need for striking \"arbitrary 50 percent ceiling on reservations.\" \"Victory for #SocialJustice! The Union Govthas withdrawn the lateral entry recruitment after strong opposition from our #INDIA bloc,\" the chief minister of the southern state wrote on X. Nevertheless, before and also after the Centre's decision, he warned the opposition to not get carried away and added \"we must remain vigilant, as the Union BJP govt will try to undermine reservation through various forms.\" Further, Stalin made the case that \"arbitrary 50% ceiling on reservation must be broken and a nationwide caste census is essential to protect the rights of the backward and oppressed.\" For the DMK party, built on the idea of \"social justice\", the caste census is considered a need of the hour to guarantee education, job opportunities and justly distribute rights to those who have been historically deprived. Earlier in the day, the chief minister flayed BJP-NDA's lateral entry proposal as a 'direct assault on social justice, depriving the meritorious SC, ST, OBC and minority officers of their deserved opportunities at the top.' The Union government, he said, should halt this practice and prioritise filling up backlog vacancies for OBCs, SCs/STs and ensure fair and equitable promotions. Stalin has been advocating for a nationwide Caste Census for the past one year and his government in June this year successfully passed a resolution in the Tamil Nadu Assembly calling on the Union government to begin work on starting population Census, which at the outset was due in 2021. 'This House considers a caste-based population census essential for formulating policies to ensure equal rights and equal opportunities in education, economy, and employment to every citizen of India. This House, therefore, unanimously urges the Union government to immediately commence the census work, which has been due since 2021, along with a caste-based population census this time,' the resolution moved in the TN assembly in June last year read. The chief minister also on multiple occasion written to PM Narendra Modi on this matter. One such letter from 2023 read, 'In a country like India, the social milieu influences the mobility of various communities across the economic levels. As caste has historically been a key determinant of the prospects of social progress in our society, it is essential that caste-based socio-economic census data be made available in public domain.",

            "Main Content": "The Tamil Nadu government initiated a tender for installing two doppler weather radars in Yercaud and Ramanathapuram to enhance cyclone tracking. These additional radars aim to cover regions currently outside the range of existing radars in Chennai, Karaikal, and Sriharikota, particularly the southern and north interior districts of the state. CHENNAI: With two months left for the arrival of northeast monsoon, the state govt has floated a tender to install two doppler weather radars, one each in Yercaud and Ramanathapuram, to track cyclones. The two instruments will cover the regions that are currently beyond the range of the existing two radars installed in Chennai and one each in Karaikal and Sriharikota. According to the tender floated by the Tamil Nadu Disaster Risk Reduction Agency, the firm that is awarded the contract will have to supply, install, test, commission and maintain two C-band dual polarised solid state power amplifier-based doppler weather radar. Both Yercaud and Ramanathapuram are tentative locations chosen for installing the instruments. A weather radar transmits electromagnetic waves and measures the energy backscattered by the liquid or solid water particles in the atmosphere. The distance the waves can reach is the reflectivity of the radar. The radar to be installed in the two locations will have a radar reflectivity or the ability to provide rain detection of up to 450km. Radars are mainly used for tracking lower latitude weather disturbances such as low pressure, depression and cyclones. Tamil Nadu gets more than 47% of the 94cm annual rainfall during the northeast monsoon, which arrives around Oct 20. In an event earlier this year, IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said the two radars, to be installed by the state govt in collaboration with IMD, will cover the southern parts of the state. At present, Chennai city is covered by two radars - an S-band radar at Port and an X-band radar at NIOT campus - and two S-band radars, one each, are in Karaikal and Sriharikota. While the radars in Kochi and Trivandrum cover some parts of TN, there are still some regions in the state that are not covered by the radar network. IMD officials said the two new radars will cover the southern and north interior districts of Tamil Nadu, which are at present outside the range of the existing radars on the east coast. While the S-band radars can cover a 500km radius, X-band can cover 150km radius. \"We want to cover more places with the radars. At present, there is not much coverage in regions south of Karaikal. If we have one at Ramanathapuram, we can cover southern districts and one at Yercaud can cover north interior districts,\" said N Senthamarai Kannan, director, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.",

Over the past nine years, the NGO has planted 19 lakh trees in the district in tribute to late President APJ Abdul Kalam. Unlike other tree-planting initiatives, Vanathukkul Tirupur documents every sapling, tracks its growth, and ensures protection until the trees are fully established. The project focuses on planting native trees on both private farmlands and public spaces to increase the green cover and attract birds. 'We have already planted one lakh trees out of our target of three lakh this year. We will complete the planting of an additional two lakh trees by the end of this year. We are planting 70 varieties of trees, 90% of which have timber value, while 10% are fruit-bearing trees meant for birds,' said managing trustee of Vetry NGO TR Sivaram. The saplings are planted in protected areas with drip irrigation systems. Prior to planting, soil and water tests are conducted. Once planted, the saplings are monitored for four years. Regular pruning and water supply, delivered through drip irrigation three times a week, are ensured. 'Due to continuous monitoring, the survival rate of the saplings exceeds 80%. For this urban forestation initiative, we spend Rs 1.50 crore to Rs 2 crore annually, with funding from private companies' CSR contributions. Recently, Federal Bank sponsored Rs 74 lakh to plant one lakh trees,' Sivaram added.",

Under the 'Anaivarukkum IIT-Madras' initiative, school students who appeared for Class XI final exams could apply for the course, regardless of their board,' project head N Hari Krishnan said. Those who qualify can join the programme after completing Class XII. The programme is open to anyone who has completed Class XII, regardless of age or professional background. Launched by IIT-M in 2021, the programme provides an alternative path to obtaining a prestigious degree. 'IIT-M provides coaching for the qualifying exam. The exam questions are based on the four-week coaching conducted by IIT, so separate coaching isn't required,' Krishnan added. The four-year course costs Rs 3.51 lakh. IIT is offering a 75% concession to students whose family income is less than Rs 1 lakh and a 50% concession to students whose family income is between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh. Students also have the flexibility to take extended breaks between academic years to manage financial responsibilities. The next batch of the IIT-M BS programme starts in September 2024, and applications are currently open. For more information, students can visit https://study.iitm.ac.in/.",

The project would help irrigate 24,468 acres of agricultural land spread acrossErode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.While launching the scheme through video conferencing from Chennai, Stalin said it would replenish 1,045 water bodies, including lakes and ponds, across the three districts.Under the scheme, 1.5 thousand million cubic feet of water from the Bhavani river would be pumped into the 1,045 identified water bodies over a period of 70 days per year. Six pumping stations have been set up for the purpose.Stalin reflected on the efforts of former chief minister Karunanidhi, who first proposed the project in 1972, and said the progress of the project was hindered by a change in govt in 1976. 'Karunanidhi had made an effort to revive the project in 1996. However, it was once again set aside after the DMK govt was toppled. In 2016, when residents of Tirupur took out an indefinite hunger strike, seeking implementation of the project, I had met them and promised that the project would be realized when the DMK forms govt again in the state,' Stalin said.Although the previous AIADMK govt initiated the scheme in 2019, Stalin said it was he who reactivated the project by sanctioning an additional fund of 250 crore. 'I am happy to launch this project that will enrich the lives of the farmers of Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.'AIADMK general secretary and opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami, meanwhile, took to X taking credit for the water project. EPS said he was the one who laid foundation stone for the project and initiated efforts to irrigate 24,500 acres across the three districts. 'By the end of the AIADMK govt's term in 2021, 90% of the project work was over. Only 10% of the work was remaining and it should have taken only six months. The DMK govt, however, halted the project as it was initiated under the AIADMK govt. It took three years to complete the remaining 10% of work, which incurred an additional expenditure of 250 crore. The residents and farmers of Erode, Tirupur and Coimbatore wouldn't have faced water woes for the past two and half years had the project been completed six months after the DMK formed govt in the state,' EPS said. EPS also called on the chief minister to inaugurate Asia's largest cattle park at Thalaivasal in Salem district at the earliest.D Prabu, convenor,Athikadavu-AvinashiFederation, urged the state govt to initiate the second phase of the project at the earliest to ensure a sustainable future.",

Awarded the 'Kalpana Chawla Award' by Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin, Sabeena's bravery and dedication earned widespread recognition after videos of her daring acts went viral.CHENNAI: As a nurse, A Sabeena is no stranger to patients hanging between life and death. The Wayanad landslides of July 30 left the 40-year-old clinging to one such thin line -- a zip line across a raging river in a ravaged swathe of the Kerala pocket to save lives.'It took two minutes to cross the river. It was spine-chilling because of the raging waters beneath me. I just closed my eyes and prayed as I went across,' Sabeena said Thursday, recalling she saw bodies being swept away under her.The single mom zip-lined 10 times over five days across the Mundakkai-Suralmalai river, saving 35 lives. A bridge over the river had collapsed, leaving dozens stranded on an island on the other side.This Independence Day, the native of Gudalur town in Tamil Nadu's Nilgiris district was speaking after receiving the 'Kalpana Chawla Award for daring and courageous enterprise' from Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin, who had especially invited her to the secretariat for the honour.Rewinding to July 30 when access was cut off across the river, the hero who stepped up to the challenge reminisced about that morning. 'It was 11am on July 30 when I got a call from colleagues at the NGO where I work, saying the Kerala govt needed nurses in Wayanad,' said Sabeena.Sabeena packed her bags, travelled 70km to Wayanad, braving heavy rain, winds and knee-deep sludge, to reach the ravaged area at 11am. 'I had seen footage of the destruction, of bodies strewn everywhere and houses washed away but that did not stop me,' Sabeena said.With currents being too strong for rescuers to swim across, NDRF teams had strung up a zip-line across the river. 'Around 100 women nurses were engaged in various tasks. NDRF forces wanted only male nurses to zip-line, but no one was available. Also, the women were too scared because of the fierce currents. I told them I would cross over. My only thought was saving lives. I did not think about my own life,' said Sabeena.Five minutes later, wearing a raincoat, Sabeena was strapped to the zip-line. Once she rappelled to the other side, she treated people who had been bitten by snakes, wounded in the landslide and many with fever.The white-knuckle rides across the river soon became a routine. She would reach the island at 11am, offer medical aid and return at 5pm. 'NDRF forces managed to bring them back using the zip-line. Later, the bridge was filled up with mud and made accessible,' Sabeena said, referring to the 35 people who were rescued.Sabeena's derring-dos came into the spotlight only a few days ago when volunteers from her village began circulating videos of her zip-lining. 'The post went viral and reached CM Stalin. I am so happy about getting this award from the CM,' said Sabeena.What overwhelms her most now is her daughter's WhatsApp status. 'For the last few days, my daughter's status reads 'There's no one in this world braver than my mom'. Seeing this gives me so much joy,' says Sabeena.Daughter Shifna, a nursing student, said the biggest lesson her mom taught her was that humanity was always 'top priority'.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAVisual StoriesPrevious8 happiness mantras for working professionalsLifestyle8 mindful morning rituals to improve focus and reduce anxietyLifestyle9 Indian recipes that can be cooked in under 10 minutesFood10 South-Indian vegetable delicacies that are a powerhouse of nutritionFood10 garden flowers that are perfect for beginnersLifestyle10 habits of people with high metabolismLifestyle8 plants to make the house look luxurious and expensiveLifestyle8 most powerful and dangerous birds in the wildLifestyle9 Best South Indian breakfasts that perfectly balance nutritionFood8 things kids value the most in their mothersLifestyleNext123Hot PicksThane School Case LiveDNC 2024 Day 2 LiveModi Poland Visit LiveBharat Bandh 21 AugustWho is Sandip GhoshLegal Drinking AgeStock Market TodayTOP TRENDINGThane Road RageMumbai Road RageMBBS Admissions Rank ListElon Musk Secret InterviewUS Fake Green CardInfosys Fresher SalaryITAT Ruling 2024Virat KohliSandip GhoshManu Bhaker",

While setting aside the RDO order, a bench of Chief Justice Alok Aradhe and Justice J Sreenivas Rao said the power to take up such revisions lay with the collector. The issue pertained to building a village tank in Mamidigi village in Nyalkal mandal of Sangareddy division. The RDO of Sangareddy in 2015 had taken up suo motu proceedings and contended that some farmers were in illegal occupation of 50 acres of tank land. He had also directed the tahsildar to modify the revenue records to the effect that the land was tank bed. Challenging this order, the farmers said that the RDO was seeking to interfere in their possession and rights 55 years after they had acquired it. The counsel for the petitioners argued that the records from 1950s were now sought to be reversed by an authority which had no such power. 'The farmers are at liberty to seek declaration of title from an appropriate court,' the bench said.

The parents said the traumatised child was perturbed at the very idea of returning to Hyderabad but the police were insisting they bring her to the police station to record her statement. The mother of the child then approached the HC seeking directions to the police to ensure that the statement was recorded at their home in Vikarabad. Her counsel Vasudha Nagaraj brought to the notice of the court that Section 26 of the Pocso Act allowed authorities to visit the residence of the survivor to record the statement. 'Not only that, they should take a special educator to talk to the child to make her confidently depose before the authorities,' she said. Directing the cops to comply with Section 26 of the Pocso Act, Justice Vijaysen Reddy ordered the magistrate at Kodangal to visit the child's home and record her statement. The judge gave the authorities 10 days to complete the task. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)",

HYDERABAD: Opposing the govt's move to install a statue of Rajiv Gandhi in the place earmarked for 'Telangana Thalli' near the secretariat, intellectuals from different walks of life in state have appealed to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to stick to the original plan.

Replacing her statue was not merely an act of removing a monument but an attempt to erase the identity and indomitable spirit of the people who fought for statehood through countless sacrifices, they said.

They opposed the state government's decision to install Rajiv Gandhi's statue in front of Telangana Secretariat, a place meant for Telangana Talli. The intellectuals including Prof Haragopal, Tankasala Ashok, Allam Narayana, Goreti Venkanna Mallepally Laxmaiah Nandini Sidda Reddy, Ayachitam Sridhar, Deshapathi Srinivas and 20 others in the open letter on Monday said Telangana Thalli represents the culture, heritage, and pride of the Telangana people.

Telangana Talli has symbolized our language, traditions, and the collective memory of our struggles for self-respect and autonomy. It is through her that we celebrate our victories, honor our sacrifices, and inspire future generations to uphold our values, they said. This concept, once ridiculed and neglected during the time of united Andhra Pradesh, was revived during the second phase of the Statehood agitation for Telangana, the intellectuals said. In the letter, they said the proposal to install a statue of Rajiv Gandhi, a leader who, while respected in many spheres, does not carry the same cultural and emotional significance for the Telugu people. This proposal is seen by many as an imposition, disregarding the sentiments of those who view Telangana Talli as the embodiment of their identity. 'We believe the statue of Rajiv Gandhi could be installed at another appropriate location. We urge the government to reconsider this decision, which is deeply hurtful and unacceptable to the people of this state.

            "Main Content": "Hyderabad: Satyam Nelli, who secured the top rank in the OU PhD entrance test a few years ago and has cleared the National Eligibility Test (NET) seven times, has repeatedly failed to secure a Junior Research Fellowship (JRF). Nelli, an OBC student, attributes his struggles to a language barrier, as the NET question paper is only available in Hindi and English. He believes that the absence of a regional language option puts students from Telangana at a disadvantage compared to those from other states. 'Until my graduation, I studied in Telugu medium. While writing the NET, I felt it would have been much easier if the questions were also available in Telugu,' Nelli told TOI. He added that since 2018, there have been demands for the NET to be conducted in vernacular languages, but the central government has not considered this request. 'I missed the JRF by a very slight margin. Fortunately, I secured the National Fellowship for OBCs and am now pursuing my PhD,' said the research scholar from OU. Recent data released in the Lok Sabha supports Nelli's claim, revealing a disparity in the number of reserved category students from Telangana securing JRFs compared to other states. In the 2023-24 academic year, only 281 OBC students from Telangana secured JRFs, a slight increase from 268 in 2019-20. Similarly, the number of Scheduled Caste (SC) students receiving JRFs in 2023-24 was 125, compared to 123 in 2019-20. In contrast, the number of reserved category students from states like West Bengal, Rajasthan, and Odisha securing JRFs has almost doubled since academic year 2019-20. The performance of ST students from Telangana has been relatively better, with 81 students receiving JRFs in 2023-24, up from 49 in 2019-20. 'Language is definitely a barrier. Additionally, the syllabus in our degree courses is an issue, as we don't cover many important topics and concepts that are necessary for NET and other entrance exams,' said Kothapalli Anil, who has appeared for NET three times but has yet to secure a JRF. Anil, who is currently working as a guest faculty member at a government college in the city, plans to attempt the NET again this year. 'Without the fellowship, I can't afford to pursue a PhD,' he added.",

The court emphasized that reserved category candidates meeting general category merit should be counted in the general category, following proper reservation rules. A fresh list must be prepared within three months, adhering to relevant rules.Allahabad high courtlast week directed UP government to draw up a fresh list for the appointment of 69,000 assistant teachers, setting aside selections made in June 2020 and Jan 2022. Revising an earlier order, the court held that reserved category candidates who qualify for the general categorymerit listshould be migrated to that category.Over 4 lakh candidatesIn December 2018, UP government announced the Assistant Teachers'RecruitmentTest-2019 (ATRE-2019), which was at the time the state's biggest recruitment drive for the selection of 69,000 primary teachers in the basic education department.About 4.3 lakh candidates registered of which approximately 4.1 lakh appeared for the test on January 6, 2019. The exam was a qualifying exercise and no caste-based reservations applied and neither was any cut-off criteria announced. It was also clarified that merely by qualifying via ATRE-2019, the incumbent would not have any right to appointment since it was only a test to establish eligibility for appointment to the post of assistant teacher.From cut-off to courtOn January 7, 2019, UP government fixed 97 out of 150 (65% marks) as the cut-off for general category and 90 (60% marks) for the reserved category. A few candidates moved high court against this cut-off. On March 29, 2019, a single-judge bench set 40% and 45% marks, respectively, as cut-offs for the reserved and general categories. However, a division bench on May 6 of that year upheld the government's initial eligibility criteria. Thereafter, the basic education department started the recruitment process based on ATRE results released in June 2020. On Oct 11, 2020, appointment letters were given to 31,277 candidates and, on Nov 30, 2020, 36,590 more candidates were recruited. Thus, 67,867 of the 69,000 posts were filled with 1,133 posts of ST candidates shown as lying vacant due to non-availability of suitable candidates.Two key issuesAfter the final merit list of June 2020, a large number of reserved category candidates moved high court. They had two main grievances: The compartmentalisation of candidates for implementing vertical reservation was not mentioned at the time of the ATRE-2019 exam though it was an open competitive examination for the post of assistant teacher. Two select lists were published without declaring category-wise cut-offs and that more than 50% of general category candidates were selected without giving due representation to reserved category candidates per their prescribed quota. That had led to MRCs or Meritorious Reserved Category students, who made it to the merit list without availing the quota cut-off being placed in the reserved category instead of general category under the provisions of Sec. 3(6) of the Reservation Act, 1994. That meant reserved category candidates were deprived of their right of reservation per Sec. 3(1) of the Reservation Act, 1994 read with Section 3(6). It was alleged that as many as 19,000-reserved category candidates, hence, missed out on quota benefits.Appointments OverruledIn court, UP government admitted that the provisions of the Reservation Act, 1994, were not properly followed in the selection of 69,000 assistant teachers. Which is why, on January 5, 2022, an additional list was published of 6,800 more appointments from among the reserved category candidates. But that list was also challenged in Allahabad high court on the grounds that it was finalised without due procedure.A single-judge bench of high court on March 3, 2023, set aside the appointment of the 6,800 additional teachers from the reserved category. It also directed that the basic education department revise the original merit list of June 1, 2020, to select 69,000 assistant teachers. The court said that any reserved-category candidate who had benefited from relaxation of marks shall not be migrated from their respective category to the unreserved category while preparing the list per the quality points based on Appendix I of Service Rules, 1981.Both reserved and unreserved category candidates challenged this order. Some petitioners said that MRC candidates had been kept in the reserved category despite securing more than the cut-off marks fixed for the unreserved categories. Petitioners from the unreserved category pleaded that some reserved category candidates, who had taken the benefit of quota cut-offs, had been wrongly kept in the unreserved category.Revision orderedA high court division bench on August 13, 2024, modified the single-bench order. While the single-judge bench had asked UP government to revise the merit list of June 2020, the division bench said that the June 2020 list should be totally ignored and a fresh list prepared within three months in line with Sec. 3(6) of Reservation Rules, 1994, and Basic Education Rules, 1981. The court, however, asked UP government to follow the ATRE-19 results. It ruled that reserved-category candidates would be migrated to the general category if they secured marks that were higher than the prescribed cut-off for the general category.'If a reserved category candidate acquires merit equivalent to the merit prescribed for the general category, the MRC candidate shall be migrated to the general category per the provisions contained in Section 3(6) of the Reservation Act, 1994,' the court ordered.Further, the bench refused to interfere in the single-bench decision rejecting the additional list of 6,800 candidates of reserved category that were identified for appointment on January 5, 2022.What next?With the entire list set to be redrawn, some candidates are bound to get adversely affected. However, the school education department said no injustice would be done to any selected candidate. The court said that 'while preparing the fresh lists... if any one of the working candidates is affected by the action of the state government/competent authority, they shall be given the session benefit so that the students may not suffer.' After a meeting chaired by CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday, UP government decided in principle to not challenge the HC order. A government statement said the CM was of the opinion that SC aspirants must get the benefit of quota per the Constitution but, at the same time, there should be no discrimination against any candidate.",

            "Main Content": "Ghaziabad: A 40-year-old man from Muradnagar died of a suspected snakebite at Delhi's GTB Hospital last week. Vikas, an amputee, is suspected to have been bitten by a viper while he was sleeping at his house around 5am on Aug 5. After the man complained of breathlessness, he was taken to the city hospital in Rawli. Doctors at city hospital told us that Vikas was bit by a snake in his leg. As his condition deteriorated, Vikas was referred to a private hospital in the city and eventually to GTB Hospital, where he succumbed on Friday. While doctors believe he died due to snakebite, the body was sent for autopsy for confirmation, Vikas's brother Siwan said. While govt data on snakebite cases is patchy, media reports indicate that the Muradnagar resident is the fifth person to succumb to snakebite in the district this year. On Aug 2, a 12-year-old boy, Manzoor, died after he was bitten by a snake in the Tilla Mode area of Sahibabad. On July 30, an eight-year-old boy, Amrit, died after he was bitten by a snake in Tonica City. On June 28, siblings Inayat (4) and Sahib (2) died in the Masuri area due to snakebite. Health department data indicates there were no snakebite-related fatalities for four years between 2018 and 2022, but three persons died in the last financial year. Sources say the data is largely under-counted. Though no independent record of snakebite cases is available for the district, as per health department data, of the 300 vials of anti-snake venom received by it this year, 115 have been administered at least 80 vials were used in Muradnagar and 10 each in Razapur and Loni. While multiple shots can be administered to a victim, depending on the severity of the venom, it is indicative of a rise in snakebite cases. Saurabh Bhatt, the ADM F&R; the nodal official for release of compensation told TOI that in 2018, UP govt declared snakebite a state disaster and announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh will be paid to the next of kin of a person who succumbs to snakebite. Between 2018 and 2022, the department did not release any compensation related to snakebite deaths. But in FY 2023-24, compensation of Rs 4 lakh each was given in three cases, he said. Officials could not confirm how many families have applied for compensation this year so far.",

The men allegedly orchestrated the fraud to manipulate the assistant teacher (mathematics) exam conducted by the Uttarakhand Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UKSSSC) on Sunday. The arrested individuals are Anupam Kumar from Patna and Udham Singh from Meerut. Singh had invited Kumar to Haridwar to solve the exam paper in place of a candidate named Kuldeep. Kumar had struck a deal with Kuldeep's relative, Sachin, agreeing to facilitate the cheating for Rs 16 lakh. SSP (Special Task Force) Ayush Agrawal said, 'We acted after receiving a tip-off about their cheating scheme. Sachin had provided Kuldeep's admit card and Aadhaar card to Singh, who then forged them to allow Kumar access to the examination centre. Singh was supposed to pay Rs 4 lakh to Anupam Kumar after solving the paper, and he would have received the remaining amount from Sachin upon Kuldeep's final selection.' Agrawal also revealed that Singh and Kumar had previously been arrested by the UP STF last year for a similar offence in another govt recruitment exam. 'They had facilitated cheating in one of the UP govt's recruitment exams. Both were lodged in a jail there but were out on bail,' SSP Agrawal further said.

The incident, which occurred last Monday, was reported by the girl during a counselling session. Police seized the bus, and the accused confessed during interrogation. Further investigation is underway. DEHRADUN: Five men, including three employees of Uttarakhand Transport Corporation, were arrested on Sunday for allegedly gang-raping a 16-year-old girl inside a bus parked at Dehradun's Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT). The assault, which occurred at night last Monday, came to light only after the girl, a resident of Moradabad in UP, reported the incident to child helpline officials during a counselling session. The three arrested state govt employees are bus driver Dharmendra Kumar, 32, conductor Devendra Kumar, 52, and ticket counter cashier Rajesh Kumar Sonkar, 38. On-contract drivers Ravi Kumar, 34, and Rajpal Singh, 57, are the other accused in the case. Police seized the bus used in the crime and sent it for forensic examination. The girl, who had run away from her home, reached Delhi's Kashmere Gate ISBT. There, she met the driver and conductor, who offered her a ride to Dehradun and paid for her ticket. Upon reaching Dehradun, they parked the bus in a secluded area of the ISBT, where they, along with the other three men, assaulted her. Police said the driver had planned to make her board a bus to Patiala from the Dehradun ISBT before they were spotted at a food stall at 1.30am on Tuesday by a security guard. He alerted an emergency helpline, prompting child helpline officials to rescue her and take her to a shelter home. At the time, she appeared normal and healthy. After she arrived at the shelter, officials conducted a basic medical check-up and a counselling session, where she claimed her parents had died and her remaining family had forced her out of the home. All accused have confessed to crime, say Uttarakhand cops. Dehradun SSP Ajai Singh added, 'She didn\u2019t appear mentally sound. She was also continuously changing her statements. She once said she was from Moradabad, and at another moment, she said she belonged to Patiala. The next day, during another counselling session, she said she had been raped. Officials immediately informed police, and a team, including female officers, visited the shelter. Once she felt comfortable, she disclosed the details of the crime during the third day of counselling. Following her statement, a case was registered against unidentified suspects on Saturday.' The police investigation, which included reviewing CCTV footage from the area, revealed that the girl was seen with one of the accused, leading to their identification and subsequent arrests. 'All of them confessed to the crime during the interrogation,' Singh said. Further investigation revealed the girl had run away from home several times before, and her parents, who are alive, were informed about the incident. They were expected to arrive in Dehradun on Sunday evening. On Sunday, Kusum Kandwal, chairperson of the Uttarakhand State Commission for Women, and Dr Geeta Khanna, chairperson of the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, assessed the girl's condition. They condemned the recent horrific incidents in Uttarakhand the rape of a nurse in Udham Singh Nagar followed by the gang rape of a teenage girl. 'Her apparent lack of concern about the incident raises questions about whether she has experienced similar trauma before,' Khanna said.",

Earlier, the top court had refused to stay Calcutta high court's May 22 judgment quashing inclusion of 77 communities, 75 of them Muslims, in West Bengal's OBC list and sought details of surveys determining their social and educational backwardness and under-representation in govt jobs requiring their inclusion in the OBC list. While agreeing to examine the validity of the HC judgment, a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra asked advocate Astha Sharma, representing West Bengal govt, to file an affidavit within a week detailing the process followed to include 77 communities in the OBC list through various executive orders between 2010 and 2012. Calcutta HC's division bench of Justices Tapabrata Chakraborty and Rajasekhar Mantha had said on May 22, 'No data was disclosed on the basis of which it was ascertained that the community concerned is not adequately represented in services under Bengal govt.'

            "Main Content": "The Supreme Court criticised the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government and police for their handling of the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar College. It questioned various aspects, including the FIR, actions against the college principal, vandalism near the crime scene, the initial suicide angle, and delays in allowing the parents to see the body. Taking suo motu cognisance of the rape and murder of a trainee doctor at Kolkata's RG Kar college, the Supreme Court on Tuesday came down heavily on the West Bengal government and police as it raised serious concerns over the handling of the matter. The top court rapped the Mamata Banerjee-led state government over several aspects of the case, saying it could not \"comprehend\" how certain events unfolded in the wake of the ghastly crime that has \"shocked the conscience\" of the nation. The Supreme Court raised five big questions on the West Bengal government in the backdrop of the case that included filing of an FIR, action taken against college principal, vandalism in the proximity to the crime scene, the initial suicide angle and delay in allowing the parents to see the body. On delay in FIR, the Supreme Court questioned Bengal government over delay in filing FIR in the case and asked what were hospital authorities doing. \"We don't understand why FIR was registered after 12 hours,\" the bench said. On actions against principal, Supreme Court slammed the state's shoddy action against college principal Dr Sandip Ghosh, asking when conduct of principal was \"under scrutiny, how was he appointed to another college immediately\". Ghosh resigned from the position of RG Kar Principal on August 12. However, within hours of resigning from RG Kar Medical College, he was reassigned the principal position at Calcutta National Medical College. CBI is grilling Ghosh for 13 to 14 hours each day by since last Friday. The CBI, which is also examining Ghosh's call records and online chats, has asked him to provide details of his calls before and after the incident on August 9 -- the night of incident. They also plan to get his call and data details from the service provider. On 'suicide' claim, \"It appears crime was detected in early hours, medical college principal tried to pass it off as suicide,\" the bench comprising CJI DY Chandrachud, justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra observed. \"What was the principal doing? Why an attempt to pass off the incident as a suicide?\" the court asked. On vandalism by mob, the court said it could not comprehend how \"West Bengal allowed the vandalisation of RG Kar hospital by a mob when it was the duty of the police to secure round the clock the hospital where a ghastly crime scene\". The court further asked: \"How mob vandalised equipment and Kolkata police did not know about it? What was the police doing?\" We are very very concerned,\" it said. On handling of body, Chief Justice Chandrachud also highlighted how parents were permitted to see the dead body after several hours. The victim's father has spoken out against what he said was the Mamata Banerjee government's \"attempt to silence\" those demanding justice for his daughter. Earlier, the victim's parents said they were made to wait for over three hours at the hospital to see their daughter's body. The Supreme Court has directed the CBI to file status report by August 22 on investigation in the case.",

            "Main Content": "Governor C V Ananda Bose described the alleged rape and murder of a woman doctor in a Kolkata hospital as a 'most shameful moment' for society. He criticized the West Bengal government and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for their handling of the situation, highlighting a perceived loss of faith among the people. NEW DELHI: West Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose has termed the alleged rape and murder of a woman doctor at a Kolkata hospital on August 9 as the \"most shameful moment\" for society and claimed that West Bengal is in a \"state of flux,\" with the public having \"lost faith in the present government.\" Bose questioned chief minister Mamata Banerjee's stance, highlighting concerns over security, government response, and police actions. Bose said in an interview, \"Bengal is in a state of flux. Students have lost faith in the government, youths are scared and women are in a state of despair. There is a feeling that the government, which is supposed to protect the citizens, is not doing its role.\" The postgraduate trainee doctor was on duty at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital when the incident occurred. The healthcare services across state-run hospitals in West Bengal were severely impacted as junior doctors staged a ceasework agitation, now in its 12th day, demanding justice for the victim and better security legislation for workplaces. Bose emphasized the deteriorating trust in law enforcement, \"Students have lost faith in the police. There is also a growing feeling of disenchantment among the youth, particularly women doctors and paramedics. As far as citizens are concerned, they are all aggrieved that the government does not act when action is called for.\" He also alleged that Kolkata Police is \"criminalised and politicised\", and expressed concern over a \"perceived disconnect between the government's actions and the needs of its citizens\". Referring to a recent rally led by chief minister Banerjee, Bose criticized the lack of clear accountability, \"There is a lack of clarity about the chief minister's position. There was a rally in which the health minister complained to the home minister about the lack of security on campuses. The home minister complained to the CM that action was not taken.\" \"People are not fooled, knowing that the health minister is also the home minister and the CM. This situation resembles Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde - everyone knows who is who. It's absurd that Bengal's chief minister parades around claiming that she seeks justice,\" Bose remarked. Drawing a parallel with the historical adage \"Nero fiddled while Rome burned,\" Bose criticized the government's handling of the crisis, suggesting it is \"failing\" to protect its people. He described the incident as \"a national shame,\" adding, \"This is a most shameful moment for Bengal society, the most disturbing moment for humanity.\" Addressing the compensation offered to the doctor's family, which the chief minister set at Rs 10 lakh, Bose stated, \"This is really inhuman to put up a price for the valuable life of a young doctor. The CM should know that money cannot buy silence.\" In a public address on August 14, chief minister Banerjee mentioned, \"The victim has departed. But I had asked her parents if they wanted to do something in their daughter's name, and I would have provided the financial support. Yes, we are ready to give Rs 10 lakh to the family.\" Bose questioned whether recent vandalism at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital was intended to distract from the murder investigation, describing the situation as \"mobocracy thwarting democracy.\" When asked if he was considering recommending President's rule in West Bengal due to the \"deteriorating\" situation, Bose indicated he would be prudent about his next steps, stating, \"What I will do as the governor will be circumspect. I will not make it come into the public domain about what I intend to do.\" Bose also expressed his intent to visit the parents of the deceased, doing so when they are emotionally ready. \"I will meet them at a time when they are mentally set for that. I respect the sentiments of the parents who lost their dear daughter. I will give them sufficient time,\" he added. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the investigation from Kolkata Police, following an order from the Calcutta High Court. A civic volunteer was arrested in connection with the crime. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)",

The accused, Vikas Singh (41), is a security guard of a G plus 4 building at Bangur Avenue in Lake Town and had allegedly committed the crime on Saturday. Singh lived alone in the building where he has been working for two years while his family stays in Bihar. Speaking to TOI, the eight-year-old girl's mother said she works at multiple households in Lake Town A block. On Saturday her daughter had gone to play in a park with other kids while she went to work. 'My girl was playing when the man approached her and lured her to his room on the terrace of a building, claiming he would give her chocolate and money to buy a doll. He abused my daughter in the room and when she began to scream, he threatened to throw her off the terrace. My daughter came out crying and later told me about the incident,' she said. The woman said she and her husband tried to locate the man over Saturday and Sunday but the girl failed to locate the building or the man. On Monday morning, while the woman and her daughter were walking outside a supermarket in Lake Town, they spotted the man riding a cycle and the girl instantly identified him and alerted her mother. 'I ran after him and held him by the collar. Initially, he started to refuse the allegations but after a large number of local people began questioning him, he broke down and sought forgiveness,' the woman said. Following this, a large group of men and women gathered at the spot and began assaulting the man while tying him up to a lamp post. Later, with the intervention of local councillor Banasree Chatterjee and officers of Lake Town police station, the man could be rescued and arrested.

The court expressed concerns about the delay in filing an FIR and the incident's impact on women's safety in workplaces. The case is now being investigated by the CBI. Court noted that the incident shocked the conscience of the nation. Supreme Court on Tuesday heard a suo motu case related to the rape and murder of a postgraduate medic at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata that has led to a massive uproar across the nation over women's safety at the workplace. The top court pulled up the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government over its lackadaisical approach while dealing with the case and asked the CBI, which is currently investigating the matter, to submit a report by Thursday. The court said it could not comprehend how 'West Bengal allowed the vandalisation of RG Kar hospital by a mob when it was the duty of the police to secure round the clock the hospital where a ghastly crime scene'. In an observation, Supreme Court said 'it appears crime was detected in early hours, medical college principal tried to pass it off as suicide'. Court noted that the incident shocked the conscience of the nation. Supreme Court slammed Kolkata Police, asking how a mob of thousands entered RG Kar Medical College on the intervening night of August 14-15. The court further asked: 'How mob vandalised equipment and Kolkata police did not know about it? What was the police doing? We are very very concerned,' the court said. 'Let the power of West Bengal government not be unleashed on protesting doctors, civil society or lawyers,' the apex court warned. Supreme Court said power of West Bengal government should not be unleashed on protestors, its time of national catharsis. The court rapped the Kolkata Police over the delay in filing FIR and asked what were hospital authorities doing. 'We don't understand why FIR was registered after 12 hours,' the bench said. 'If women are not able to go to work and conditions are not safe, we are denying them equality,' said Chief Justice Chandrachud. The court said that the Kolkata rape case is 'not a matter of a particular offence, but something which affects the institution of health care pan-India'. Supreme Court also criticised circulation of name and graphic details of the victim doctor and said it violated the dignity of the deceased. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said 'Let West Bengal not be in denial mode, there's complete failure of law and order in state'. CJI Chandrachud told Kapil Sibal, representing that state, that there is 'unexplained delay in the registration of FIR' and said state must ensure that those who attacked hospital on August 14 are booked and prosecuted. 'There is undoubtedly an unexplained delay in the registration of FIR regarding the rape-murder incident at RG Kar hospital,' CJI said. A bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra heard the case on Tuesday. The apex court's intervention comes after widespread outrage and strikes by doctors across the country, who are accusing the state police of mishandling the case. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), the largest organization of doctors in the country, has spearheaded the call for justice for the murdered doctor. On Saturday, the IMA organized a nationwide strike, halting all non-essential medical services for 24 hours. On Wednesday night, thousands of women across the country took to the streets to demand justice for the victim, joining 'Reclaim The Night' marches. A postgraduate trainee doctor was raped and murdered at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata while on duty last week. The semi-naked body of the 32-year-old woman was found on August 9 morning in the seminar hall of the government-run hospital in the West Bengal capital. A civic volunteer has been arrested in connection with the crime.

            "Main Content": "Congress has called on the West Bengal government to address parents' concerns in the R G Kar rape-murder case. Spokesperson Pawan Khera said that the parents' questions deserved a sensitive response. This position comes amid tensions with ally Trinamool Congress, following Rahul Gandhi's remarks suggesting mishandling of the case. Tensions with ally TMC started following Rahul Gandhi's remarks suggesting mishandling of the case. NEW DELHI: Congress on Monday said West Bengal government must answer the doubts raised by the parents of the victim doctor in the R G Kar rape-murder case that has roiled the nation with protests, doubling down on its \"neutral\" stance that has angered ally Trinamool Congress party (TMC). Asked about the \"silence of CM Mamata Banerjee\" on questions raised by the victim's parents, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the TMC leader is not silent. \"But their (parents') questions need to be answered, their grievances need to be addressed and their doubts need to be heard with sensitivity,\" he said, adding, \"we have been through this experience in the Nirbhaya case and we know what the parents go through.\" He expressed confidence that the parents will get the answers and will not have any complaints with the investigations. Congress sympathies with the victims' parents, as echoed by protestors, is in stark contrast to the strong pushback from TMC as well as unstinted faith in the ruling Bengal party expressed by other INDIA allies like the Samajwadi Party. Instead, Rahul's \"Kathua to Kolkata\" remark which hinted at \"an attempt to save the accused instead of providing justice to the victim\" elicited strong reaction from TMC which said the Congress leader spoke without correct information about the case. TMC on Sunday picked on Karnataka governor's nod for prosecution of chief minister Siddaramaiah and asked Rahul if he would ask the CM to resign in view of serious allegations of corruption.",

Locals were alerted to his cry for help and pulled the child out of the drain. However, by the time he was taken to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, he was declared dead on arrival.HC noted that the incident occurred near an unauthorised colony and recorded that the child's post-mortem done at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital Mortuary revealed that he died due to asphyxia as a result of drowning.Aggarwal contended that the authorities, including Delhi govt, DDA, and MCD, were 'well aware that there is no barricading at the drain and children play in the field beside the drain. Therefore, any mishap could have happened'.Urging HC to intervene, the plea alleged that it was criminal negligence on the part of the respondents to not barricade the open drain despite knowing that a population resides near it and children play in the field adjoining the open drain.It argued that the authorities are 'severally and jointly responsible as they all were well aware that the drain is open, and a population resides near it, and children play in the area'.",

            "Main Content": "New Delhi: After successfully experimenting with treating sludge at the Kondli sewage treatment plant two years ago, Delhi Jal Board hasn't adopted the technology at the remaining STPs. There was no official comment from DJB on the matter, but sources said the initial plan was to replicate the Kondli setup in all the STPs in two years. Designed to reduce DJB's dependence on the Municipal Corporation of Delhi in disposing of the end product of sewage treatment, the processing of sludge at Kondli was based on hot air oxidation. Sewage sludge is the solid, semisolid or slurry residual material that is a byproduct of the sewage treatment processes. In the experimental process, sludge was dried using hot air and converted to biochar. The standard process at the STPs creates two by-products. One is treated water, which is used for horticultural purposes while some of it also ends back in the river. The other is sludge, which is removed using a scraper and then transferred to a tank where it is decomposed by anaerobic bacteria to produce biogas. This biogas is used as a low-cost fuel to generate electricity. There still is some sludge remaining after this. It is dumped in the sludge yard operated either by DJB or MCD. The dump yard emanates a foul smell and also causes health risks to people living in the yard's vicinity. DJB produces 700-800 tonnes of sludge at its STPs every day. Sludge produced during the processing of industrial effluent at treatment plants can be hazardous in nature. The water utility has 13 plants which treat industrial effluents. 'Delhi Jal Board is unable to treat the sludge in a better way because the pilot projects at Kondli and a smaller one at Okhla were not extended to the other STPs,' said a board source. 'There are now a total of 38 operational STPs. Some of the sludge produced at these plants ends up in DJB yards and some at MCD landfills. But the yards have almost reached their full capacity.' The installed capacity of STPs is 700 million gallons of sewage per day, but they currently process only around 600 million gallons daily.",

In June 2000, the National Conference government under Farooq Abdullah passed a resolution in the Assembly seeking to restore the pre-1953 constitutional position in the state. It was, however, rejected by the Union Cabinet headed by then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Narendra Modi government abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, in 2019 and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two Union Territories -- Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The NC manifesto for the upcoming Assembly polls also promised to seek amnesty for all political prisoners and dignified return of Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley. Free 200 units of electricity, relief from power and water crisis, transfer of hydro-electric power projects to Jammu and Kashmir and providing 12 LPG cylinders to the economically weaker sections each year for free are among the other pledges made by the party in its poll document. Releasing the manifesto at a press conference here, NC Vice President Omar Abdullah said the party is making only those promises it can deliver. He described the manifesto as the NC's vision document and a roadmap for governance. The manifesto makes 12 broad promises, including striving for the full implementation of the Autonomy Resolution passed by the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in 2000. \"We strive to restore (Articles) 370-35A, and statehood as prior to August 5, 2019,\" the NC poll document said. In the interim period, \"we will endeavour to redraw the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019, and the Transaction of Business of the Government of Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir Rules, 2019\", it said. The manifesto has promised that the Jammu and Kashmir assembly, in its first list of business after elections, will pass a resolution against the Centre's decision to strip the region of its statehood and special status. The NC said it will make efforts to modify, annul, and repeal post-August 5, 2019, laws that impact the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.",

The attack occurred during a joint patrol of CRPF and J&K; police. Officials have attributed the increased violence to highly trained terrorists employing advanced tactics and technology. JAMMU: An inspector from CRPF's 187th battalion was killed in a terrorist attack in a remote forest of Udhampur district Monday, bringing the total number of security force fatalities in J&K; to 18 since May, with 14 in Jammu region and an additional four in Kashmir.

A CRPF constable was killed in Kathua on June 12, and Corporal Vikky Pahade died in an ambush on an IAF convoy in Poonch on May 4. In Kashmir, two soldiers were killed in Anantnag on Aug 10, and two others died in separate gunfights in Kupwara on July 24 and 27. Security has been intensified in the mountainous interior following EC's announcement of assembly elections in J&K; after a decade-long gap in three phases from September 18 to October 1. Dudu-Basantgarh is situated about 65km from Ramnagar town and shares its borders with Bhaderwah and Marmat in Doda district to the east, and Basoli-Billawar in Kathua district to the southeast. The region falls on a key axis connecting Kathua, Udhampur, and Doda, which has been a conduit for terrorists entering Kashmir valley. The dense vegetation in the upper reaches of these districts provides natural cover for terrorists. The recent surge in violence in Jammu region has been attributed to 'highly trained intruders' from Pakistan, who are working in small, mobile groups of three to four terrorists. Officials said terrorists have shifted their tactics from suicide attacks to a 'hit-and-run' guerilla strategy, engaging in jungle warfare. This change in strategy has proved fatal for security forces in several instances. Armed with sophisticated weapons such as M4 carbines and armour-piercing bullets, these groups are also using advanced tech, including iridium satellite phones and thermal imaging devices. Their ability to coordinate attacks has become a major challenge for security forces, particularly in the region's remote and rugged terrain.",

            "Published Date": "TOI News Desk / TIMESOFINDIA.COM / May 6, 2024, 16:28 IST",
            "Main Content": "A recent study conducted by researchers from the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has revealed that marine heatwaves are causing widespread bleaching of coral reefs in the Lakshadweep Sea. The survey results from various Lakshadweep Islands showed that a significant percentage of hard coral species have undergone severe bleaching due to prolonged exposure to abnormally high ocean temperatures since late October 2023. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), this level of DHW poses a substantial risk of coral bleaching, threatening the region's diverse marine ecosystems. \"Such heat stress levels signify a severe threat to coral health, leading to extensive bleaching where corals lose the symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), compromising their survival by depriving them of essential nutrients,\" said Dr K R Sreenath, Senior Scientist of CMFRI. He warned that if the Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) continue to increase, it could lead to an unprecedented biodiversity crisis due to the mortality of multiple species. Dr. Shelton Padua, another senior scientist at CMFRI, identified excessive atmospheric heat transfer and changes in ocean currents as the main causes of these marine heatwaves. The Lakshadweep Sea, located between 80.0 to 12.0 N latitude and 71.0 to 75.0 E longitude, has been experiencing temperatures consistently rising more than one degree Celsius above the norm since October 27, 2023. The ongoing marine heatwaves are expected to cause significant economic losses by disrupting the vital ecosystem services that are crucial to the livelihoods of coastal communities, particularly in the tourism and fisheries sectors. Moreover, the death and disintegration of coral reefs can leave coastal communities vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise. The heatwaves also pose a threat to other critical marine habitats, such as seagrass meadows, which are experiencing impaired photosynthesis, reduced growth, and hindered reproductive functions.",
